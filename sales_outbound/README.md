# Intellidial Sales Outbound – Apollo + 1:1 Email Plan

---

## 1. Short answer to your question

Yes — for a **small, very specific niche (±150 companies)**, it is **perfectly valid (and often better)** to:

- Find your leads on **Apollo**
- Then **email them directly, one by one**, with **highly personalized messages**

Because your audience is small and valuable, the goal is **quality over volume**: a tight list, strong relevance, and very personal outreach.

---

## 2. Strategy overview

**Goal:** Book qualified conversations and pilots with **HubSpot-using companies in your target industries** who can benefit from AI-powered phone research/outbound (Intellidial).

**Channel:**  
- Primary: **Cold email (1:1, highly personalized)**  
- Optional follow-up: LinkedIn or phone once interest is shown.

**Core idea:**  
Use Apollo to **pre-qualify**: company size, geography, tech stack (HubSpot), industry. Then send **short, specific emails** that:

- Show you understand their context
- Clearly explain **what Intellidial is and why it’s relevant to them**
- Offer a **low-friction next step** (quick call or pilot).

---

## 3. Ideal Customer Profile (ICP) – for Apollo filters

You can adjust, but a starting point:

- **CRM:** Must use **HubSpot** (company or contacts with HubSpot tech tag).
- **Location:** South Africa first (or your chosen region).
- **Size:**  
  - Minimum: 10–20 employees (enough process/volume to care).  
  - Upper bound: 500–1,000 employees (still reachable, not enterprise bureaucracy).
- **Industries (examples)**  
  - B2B services with lots of phone contact:  
    - Medical/healthcare providers, clinics, medical aids  
    - Property / real estate / property management  
    - Recruitment / HR agencies  
    - Financial and insurance brokers  
    - SaaS / tech companies doing outbound SDR work
- **Seniority / titles:**  
  - Revenue: Head of Sales, VP Sales, Sales Director, RevOps  
  - Ops: COO, Head of Operations, Call Center Manager  
  - Marketing / Growth: CMO, Head of Growth, Demand Gen

The output should be a **small, clean list (100–200 accounts)** with **1–3 strong contacts per account**.

---

## 4. Apollo research process (step by step)

1. **Define 1–2 core use cases for this batch**
   - Example A: “Companies running outbound SDR teams that want more qualified meetings without hiring more SDRs.”
   - Example B: “Firms that need structured phone research (e.g. rate verification, provider checks, survey calls).”

2. **Create a saved search in Apollo**
   - Add filters for:
     - Location (e.g. South Africa)
     - Employee count
     - Industry
     - Technologies → HubSpot
   - Save this search so you can revisit and tweak.

3. **Manually review** top matches
   - Open company websites for the first 30–50.
   - Confirm they **actually look like a fit** for Intellidial (do they rely on phone + CRM?).
   - Remove obvious bad fits.

4. **Select decision makers & champions**
   - For each company, pick:
     - 1 main decision maker (e.g. Head of Sales / Ops)
     - 1 backup / champion (e.g. Sales Manager, RevOps)

5. **Export to a small working list**
   - Export to CSV or into a dedicated Apollo list called e.g. **“ID – HubSpot SA – Batch 01”**.
   - Limit batch size to **30–50 companies** for your first experiment.

---

## 5. Daily workflow (what you do each day)

**Target:** 10–20 **high‑quality** emails per day, not volume blasting.

1. **Pick 5–10 companies for today**
   - From your Batch 01 list, choose a small number you can research properly.

2. **Research each company (5–10 minutes)**
   - Homepage headline: What’s their main promise?
   - Blog/careers: Do they mention outbound, call centers, research, NPS, surveys?
   - Any signals of:
     - Sales team size
     - Customer success / support team
     - Phone numbers prominently listed

3. **Create a simple note for each**
   - “Why are they a fit for Intellidial?”  
   - “What result would impress them?” (e.g. “More qualified demos without hiring more SDRs”, “Faster price/mystery-shopping surveys”).

4. **Write 1:1 email using a simple framework (see next section)**
   - Use the same structure, but change the **hook** to reference something real from their site / industry.

5. **Send and log**
   - Send via your email, log them in a simple Google Sheet / Notion / CRM for now:
     - Company
     - Contact
     - Date sent
     - Subject line
     - Status (sent / replied / meeting / not interested)

6. **Follow up**
   - Send 2–3 follow‑ups over 2–3 weeks to non‑responders.
   - Keep follow‑ups very short (“just checking if this is relevant; happy to close the loop if not”).

---

## 6. Email framework for 1:1 outreach

You can adapt wording, but this structure works well for a niche product like Intellidial.

**Structure**

1. **Subject** – specific and relevant  
   - “Idea for your HubSpot + outbound calls”  
   - “Quick question about your phone outreach”  
   - “Fewer manual calls, cleaner data”

2. **Opening line – personalized**  
   - Reference their role / company / something from the site.  
   - Example: “Saw that you’re running a sales team at [Company] and using HubSpot – looks like you rely heavily on outbound and follow‑up calls.”

3. **Problem + context**  
   - One or two sentences:  
   - “Teams I speak with struggle to keep up with manual calling, and end up with messy notes in HubSpot and very patchy data on what was actually said on calls.”

4. **What Intellidial does (one line)**  
   - “Intellidial is an AI-powered phone research tool that calls your lists, has natural conversations, and writes back structured data + transcripts into your workflow.”

5. **Value for them (tailored)**  
   - “For you, that could mean: qualifying more leads without hiring more SDRs, and having clean data on every conversation instead of half-filled notes.”

6. **Social proof / proof of seriousness**  
   - “We’re live in production with real clients and focusing specifically on teams using HubSpot.”

7. **Clear, low-friction CTA**  
   - “Would it be crazy to try a small 20–30 call pilot together over the next 2–3 weeks to see if this moves the needle for you?”  
   - Or: “If this sounds interesting, I can share a 3–4 slide overview or jump on a 20‑minute call.”

8. **Soft close**  
   - “If you’re not the right person, is there someone on your team who owns outbound or call operations?”

---

## 7. Follow‑up structure (simple sequence)

You don’t need a complex sequence tool yet; just 2–3 simple follow‑ups:

- **Follow‑up 1 (3–4 business days later)**  
  - “Just checking if this is worth a quick look for [Company]. If not, happy to close the loop.”

- **Follow‑up 2 (7–10 days later)**  
  - Share **one specific benefit or idea**:  
  - “One example: we recently used Intellidial to run 200 research calls in a few days for a B2B team, with full transcripts and structured answers. Could be interesting if you’re planning any campaigns like that this year.”

- **Follow‑up 3 (optional)**  
  - “Last note from me on this. If this isn’t a priority now, I won’t chase you – but if you are exploring ways to scale phone outreach without growing headcount, Intellidial might be worth revisiting later.”

---

## 8. Metrics to track

At your stage, keep it very simple:

- **Per batch (e.g. 30–50 companies)**
  - # of unique companies emailed
  - # of replies
  - # of positive replies (interest / meeting)
  - # of meetings booked
  - # of pilots started

From here, you’ll see:

- Which **industries** respond best
- Which **titles** respond best
- Which **email angles** (research vs. outbound volume vs. data quality) resonate

Double down on what works; stop spending time on segments that don’t respond.

---

## 9. How Intellidial fits into this outbound story

When you talk to leads (on email or on calls), connect your product to their reality:

- “You probably already have data in HubSpot, but missing **consistent, structured call data**.”
- “Your team is already overloaded with calls; you’re not going to hire 5 more SDRs just for research or qualification.”
- “You want to **test new markets or campaigns quickly** without committing to headcount.”

Position Intellidial as:

- A **lever** to run more experiments and campaigns via phone  
- A way to **clean up and enrich** the data that flows into HubSpot  
- A tool that gives **transcripts and recordings** so they can coach and improve their own messaging

---

## 10. Concrete 2‑week action plan

**Week 1**

- Day 1–2:  
  - Finalize ICP (HubSpot + industries + size).  
  - Build and save Apollo search.  
  - Manually review and clean first 50 companies.

- Day 3–5:  
  - Send **10–15 personalized emails per day** (30–40 total).  
  - Start logging results in a simple sheet.  
  - Take notes on which hooks feel easiest to write.

**Week 2**

- Day 6–7:  
  - Send follow‑up 1 to all non‑responders.  
  - Add a fresh 10–20 new companies based on learnings.

- Day 8–10:  
  - Send a second batch of 10–15 new companies per day.  
  - Book and run first calls with interested leads.  
  - Offer **small, concrete pilots** rather than big vague deals.

At the end of 2 weeks, review:

- How many positive replies? From which segments?  
- Which email angle worked best?  
- Should you:
  - Go deeper into this same niche?  
  - Adjust filters (industry, size, job titles)?  
  - Increase daily volume now that you have a working message?

---

## 11. Summary

- With a **small, highly targeted HubSpot niche**, it is absolutely sensible to:
  - Use **Apollo** to find the right 100–200 companies.
  - **Email them manually, one by one**, with strong personalization.
- Focus on:
  - A clear ICP and small, high‑intent batches  
  - Short, specific emails tied to real problems  
  - Simple metrics and consistent follow‑up

This `sales_outbound` plan is your **starting playbook**.  
As you learn which segments and messages work best, you can refine this doc and evolve from manual 1:1 emailing into more scalable outbound motions.
