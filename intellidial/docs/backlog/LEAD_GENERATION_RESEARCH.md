# Lead Generation Research - Backlog

## Current Status
- ✅ Created lead lists: TOP_CONVERSION_LEADS.csv, SMALLER_COMPANIES_HIGH_CONVERSION.csv, HIGH_VOLUME_OUTBOUND_LEADS.csv
- ❌ **Many company names are generic/placeholder - need real company research**

### Task: Research Real SA Companies for Lead Lists

**Location**: `leads_gen/` folder

**What needs to be done**:

1. **Research Methods** (use these to find real companies):

   **Google Search:**
   - [ ] "appointment setting services South Africa"
   - [ ] "lead generation agencies Cape Town"
   - [ ] "lead generation agencies Johannesburg"
   - [ ] "market research fieldwork companies South Africa"
   - [ ] "telemarketing companies South Africa"
   - [ ] "cold calling services Cape Town"
   - [ ] "B2B outreach agencies South Africa"
   - [ ] "sales development agencies Johannesburg"
   - [ ] "customer onboarding services South Africa"
   - [ ] "follow-up call services Cape Town"

   **LinkedIn Search:**
   - [ ] Search → Companies → "appointment setting South Africa"
   - [ ] Filter: Location = South Africa, Company size = 1-50, 51-200
   - [ ] Search → Companies → "lead generation agency South Africa"
   - [ ] Search → Companies → "market research fieldwork South Africa"
   - [ ] Search → Companies → "telemarketing South Africa"
   - [ ] Export company names + websites

   **Apollo.io (if available):**
   - [ ] Industry = "Marketing & Advertising"
   - [ ] Keywords = "appointment setting" OR "lead generation" OR "telemarketing"
   - [ ] Location = South Africa
   - [ ] Company size = 10-200 employees
   - [ ] Export company name, website, employee count

   **Directories:**
   - [ ] Yellow Pages SA: Search "appointment setting", "lead generation"
   - [ ] Hello Peter: Search service providers
   - [ ] Clutch.co: Filter by South Africa, Marketing/Advertising

2. **Update CSV Files**:
   - [ ] Replace generic names in `HIGH_VOLUME_OUTBOUND_LEADS.csv` with real companies
   - [ ] Verify websites exist (check each URL)
   - [ ] Add real company names to `SMALLER_COMPANIES_HIGH_CONVERSION.csv`
   - [ ] Remove duplicates across all CSV files

3. **Priority Companies** (focus on these first):
   - [ ] Lead generation/appointment setting agencies (highest need - they make calls daily)
   - [ ] Telemarketing companies (core business is outbound calls)
   - [ ] Market research fieldwork companies (high volume survey calls)
   - [ ] Customer onboarding services (call every new customer)
   - [ ] Follow-up call services (post-service calls)

4. **Verification**:
   - [ ] Check each website exists and is active
   - [ ] Verify company is actually in SA (not just .co.za domain)
   - [ ] Confirm they're in the right industry/use case
   - [ ] Remove companies that don't fit criteria

**Priority**: Medium (important for outreach but not blocking core app development)

**Time estimate**: 4-6 hours to research and verify 100-150 real companies

**Output**: Updated CSV files with real company names, verified websites, ready for email enrichment
