# Backlog

This folder contains tasks and features that are planned but not yet implemented.

## Current Backlog Items

- [Email Sending](./EMAIL_SENDING.md) - Implement real email sending for team invitations and other notifications

---

## How to Use This Backlog

1. **Add new items**: Create a new `.md` file for each major feature/task
2. **Update status**: Mark completed items with ✅, in-progress with 🚧, not started with ❌
3. **Link to code**: Include file paths and line numbers where relevant
4. **Break down tasks**: Use checkboxes for sub-tasks
5. **Add context**: Include why it's needed, current state, and requirements

## Priority Guidelines

- **High**: Blocks core functionality or user experience
- **Medium**: Important but not blocking
- **Low**: Nice to have, can be deferred
