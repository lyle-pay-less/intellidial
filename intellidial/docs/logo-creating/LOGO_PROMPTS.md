# Intellidial Logo — Fixed Prompt (T Replacement)

**Problem:** The T is showing as a letter instead of a phone receiver icon.

**Solution:** Use this more explicit prompt.

## Fixed Prompt (Very Explicit)

```
Modern logo for "Intellidial". Left: rounded square icon, teal background (#14B8A6). The phone handset shape is CREATED using circuit board lines and connection nodes - the AI graphics form the phone outline itself. Use subtle white or light gray circuit lines to draw the phone shape. Right: "Intelli" text in dark gray bold sans-serif, then IMMEDIATELY AFTER "Intelli" place a phone receiver ICON (vertical orientation, teal #14B8A6) - this phone icon REPLACES and STANDS IN FOR the letter T. After the phone icon, add "dial" text in teal (#14B8A6). The wordmark should read: "Intelli" [phone icon] "dial" - where the phone icon is where the T would normally be. Do NOT include the letter T at all. The phone receiver icon should be the same height as the text letters. Style: professional, modern, B2B SaaS. Horizontal layout.

## Alternative: Even More Explicit

```
Intellidial logo: Left - rounded square icon, teal (#14B8A6), phone handset formed by circuit board lines (white/light gray). Right - wordmark: "Intelli" (dark gray, bold sans-serif) + phone receiver icon (teal #14B8A6, vertical, same height as text) + "dial" (teal #14B8A6). CRITICAL: The phone receiver icon REPLACES the letter T completely. The wordmark structure is: "Intelli" + [phone icon] + "dial". There is NO letter T in the wordmark. The phone icon is positioned exactly where a T would be. Style: modern, professional. Horizontal layout.

## If Using Image Editor Instead

If you want to fix the existing logo image:
1. Open the logo in an image editor (Photoshop, Figma, Canva, etc.)
2. Remove/erase the letter "T" from "Intelli"
3. Insert a phone receiver icon (vertical, teal #14B8A6) in its place
4. Ensure proper spacing between "Intelli", phone icon, and "dial"

**Use the "Fixed Prompt" above to regenerate the logo with the T properly replaced.**
