---

## Recommendation: **Keep Current Names** ✅

### Why:

1. **Familiarity Matters**
   - Prospects already understand "Starter → Growth → Pro → Business → Enterprise"
   - Changing names requires re-education

2. **Focus on Value, Not Names**
   - Better to communicate value through:
     - Features (CRM integration, Slack notifications)
     - Pricing (cost per call)
     - Use cases (perfect for sales teams, agencies)
   - Names are just labels - value is what matters

3. **Standard Practice**
   - Most successful SaaS companies use generic names
   - Your competitors likely use similar names
   - Don't fix what isn't broken

4. **Target Audience is Diverse**
   - Sales teams, agencies, recruiters, market research
   - Generic names work for everyone
   - Industry-specific names exclude some customers

### What to Do Instead:

**Focus on communicating value:**

1. **Add descriptive subtitles:**
   - Starter: "Perfect for testing"
   - Growth: "Ideal for small teams"
   - Pro: "Built for agencies"
   - Business: "High-volume calling"
   - Enterprise: "Custom solutions"

2. **Emphasize features:**
   - "Pro includes CRM integration"
   - "Business includes all integrations"
   - "Enterprise includes custom integrations"

3. **Show use cases:**
   - "Perfect for sales teams"
   - "Ideal for lead gen agencies"
   - "Built for market research"
