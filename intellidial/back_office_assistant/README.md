## Status

🚧 **Planning Phase** - See [IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md](./IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md) for detailed roadmap.

## Quick Start (Future)

Once implemented, the assistant will be accessible:
- Via chat widget in dashboard
- On projects page ("Review Instructions" button)
- On notifications page (contextual help)
- Via API endpoints

## Key Feature: Self-Healing System

The assistant **proactively monitors** all projects and automatically:
1. **Detects issues** (low success rates, missing data, etc.)
2. **Generates suggestions** with specific before/after instructions
3. **Calculates ROI** (e.g., "Improve success rate by 15%")
4. **Sends notifications** (important priority)
5. **Shows on instructions page** for one-click accept/reject
6. **Tracks impact** and learns what works

This creates a **continuous improvement loop** - the system gets better automatically without manual intervention.

## Monetization

The assistant can be monetized using **call minutes** - users pay for assistant queries using their existing call minutes allocation. This creates a **high-margin revenue stream** (80-95% margins) while encouraging optimization.

See [MONETIZATION.md](./MONETIZATION.md) for detailed strategy.
