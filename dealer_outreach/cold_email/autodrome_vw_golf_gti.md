## Research summary

### AutoTrader
- **Rating:** 3.5 stars (6 reviewers) — 49% five-star, 17% each for 4/3/2-star, 0% one-star.
- **Reviews used for angle:**
  - **Kyle N** (02 Feb 2026), 1.5 stars: *"Never responded..."* — "No response to whatapp or email". Autodrome reply (13 Feb 2026): "Hi Kyle Norris, sorry to hear we missed the opportunity to work with you. We take all feedback seriously and apologize for any inconvenience caused. We value your input and want to improve. One of our Friendly Sales Staff will contact you today."
  - **Takeaway:** Recent, specific failure (no response to WhatsApp or email). Dealer has already said they "want to improve" and promised follow-up. Strong fit for IntelliDial: every lead gets a call so the next Kyle doesn't slip through.

### Google
- **Rating:** 4.3 stars (80 reviews).
- **Marise Swart** (4 months ago), 1 star: "Very disappointing service! Will not visit Auto Drome again or recommend it to anyone." (translated from Afrikaans.) Other visible responses from Autodrome are about post-sale/maintenance.
- **Takeaway:** One strong negative on service; AutoTrader Kyle N review is the clearest lead-follow-up angle — use that in the email.

## Template used
**Template A + B** — "I enquired and you didn't call back" + Kyle N "No response to whatapp or email" + Autodrome's own reply ("we want to improve… Sales Staff will contact you today"). Frame IntelliDial as the way to deliver on that promise so no more Kyles get missed.

## Email draft — SEND THIS ONE

**Subject:** my Golf GTI enquiry on AutoTrader

```
Hi Autodrome team,

I enquired about your 2012 Volkswagen Golf GTI on AutoTrader on 18 February — no callback.

I saw a recent review on your AutoTrader page: "No response to whatapp or email." Your team replied that you take feedback seriously and want to improve. That's exactly what I built a fix for — so the next lead gets a call before they write a review like that.

Intellidial calls your leads back within 60 seconds — day or night, weekends included. AI qualifies the buyer, answers questions about the car, and books a viewing into your calendar. You get a notification: qualified warm lead, confirmed time slot. No missed WhatsApps, no missed emails.

Can I show you what this looks like for one of your leads?

## Alternate subject lines

| Subject | Notes |
|---------|-------|
| `my Golf GTI enquiry on AutoTrader` | **Recommended** — specific, low-key |
| `VW Golf GTI enquiry — no callback` | More direct |
| `Never responded — I built a fix for lead follow-up` | Ties to Kyle N's headline; use if you want to be more direct |

## Follow-up schedule

| When | Action |
|------|--------|
| **Day 3** | Bump: "Just floating this to the top in case it got buried. Happy to close the loop if it's not relevant." |
| **Day 7** | Send Loom demo link (90-second walkthrough). Mention: "9 cars on AutoTrader — every enquiry could get a call in 60 seconds." If you have Pieter or RP email by then, CC. |
| **Day 14** | Breakup: "Last note from me. If speed-to-lead isn't a priority now, no worries. If things change, I'm here." If no reply, consider a short call to Pieter (082 577 1761) or RP (072 180 6793). |

## Notes
- **Kyle N (02 Feb 2026)** is very recent — same month as your enquiry. "Never responded... No response to whatapp or email" is a direct fit for IntelliDial. You're not attacking; you're offering the fix they already said they want ("we want to improve").
- **Pieter and RP** — only mobile numbers on the contact page. If you find sales or principal emails (e.g. on website or AutoTrader), add them for follow-up or CC. Otherwise Day 14 phone follow-up is an option.
- **9 cars** on AutoTrader — small, established dealer (since 1994). Every lead matters.
- **Paarl** — Western Cape, same region as your other Cape Town dealer emails.
