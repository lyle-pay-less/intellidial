## Research summary

### AutoTrader
- **Rating:** 3.2 stars (9 reviewers) — 56% five-star, 44% one-star. Polarised.
- **Reviews used for angle:**
  - **Andre K** (06 Aug 2025), 1 star: *"No response"*
  - **Thapelo peter M** (07 Sep 2025), 4.5 stars: "Accurate information at all times keep it up"
  - **AutoTrader Customer** (05 Nov 2025), 5 stars: "Absolute professional 5 star service from Jade!!"
  - **Kgosi N** (20 Aug 2025), 5 stars: "Excellent" — Jade helped, perfect service.
- **Takeaway:** When they respond (Jade, etc.), they're strong. When they don't, you get Andre K's "No response." Your no-callback + Andre K = strong fit. 61 cars = high volume; every missed lead is a missed sale.

### Google
- **Rating:** 3.8 stars (84 reviews). Goodwood, Cape Town.
- **Angela McPherson** (4 years ago), 1 star: "Nobody gets back to you" — after-sales context. Other lowest reviews (Sonja Matthee, Andre Pienaar) are about misleading info / odometer / after-sales, not lead follow-up.
- **Takeaway:** Stick to AutoTrader "No response" in the email; keeps angle to lead follow-up only.

---

## Template used
**Template A + B** — "I enquired and you didn't call back" + Andre K "No response". Optional: when they respond (Jade) they're excellent; the gap is when the lead slips through. 61 cars = every lead matters.

## Email draft — SEND THIS ONE

**Subject:** my Golf R enquiry on AutoTrader

```
Hi Autoworld team,

I enquired about your 2017 Volkswagen Golf R Auto on AutoTrader on 18 February — no callback.

I saw one of your AutoTrader reviews: "No response." With 61 cars listed, that's a lot of enquiries — and every one that slips through is a missed sale. I built IntelliDial to fix exactly this: it calls your leads back within 60 seconds, day or night, weekends included. AI qualifies the buyer, answers questions about the car, and books a viewing into your calendar. You get a notification with the qualified warm lead and confirmed time slot. Just forward the leads email to us.

Worth a look for Autoworld Exotic?

## Alternate subject lines

| Subject | Notes |
|---------|-------|
| `my Golf R enquiry on AutoTrader` | **Recommended** — specific, low-key |
| `VW Golf R enquiry — no callback` | More direct |
| `No response — I built a fix for lead follow-up` | Ties to Andre K; use if you want to be more direct |

## Follow-up schedule

| When | Action |
|------|--------|
| **Day 3** | Bump: "Just floating this to the top in case it got buried. Happy to close the loop if it's not relevant." |
| **Day 7** | Send Loom demo link (90-second walkthrough). Mention: "61 cars on AutoTrader — every enquiry could get a call in 60 seconds." |
| **Day 14** | Breakup: "Last note from me. If speed-to-lead isn't a priority now, no worries. If things change, I'm here." |

## Notes
- **Andre K "No response"** — Direct lead-follow-up complaint; strong fit for IntelliDial. You don't name him; the quote speaks for itself.
- **61 cars** — High volume; "a lot of enquiries" and "every one that slips through is a missed sale" is credible. Goodwood / Richmond — Cape Town, same dealer pool.
- **Jade** (positive reviews) — When they respond they're strong; angle is "every lead gets a call" so none slip through. Don't need to reference Jade in email #1.
- **Google** — "Nobody gets back to you" (Angela) is after-sales; keep email to lead response only.
