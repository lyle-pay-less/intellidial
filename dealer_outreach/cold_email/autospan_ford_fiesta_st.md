## Research summary

### AutoTrader
- **Rating:** 4.5 stars (22 reviewers).
- **Listings:** 6 cars. "View By Appointment. Welcome to our garage, where we specialize in offering top-notch cars at prices that won't break the bank. Our commitment to providin..."
- **Takeaway:** No specific "no callback" review quoted in research — angle is your own enquiry (no callback) + 6 cars / appointment-based = every lead matters. Strong reputation (4.5★) so tone is factual, not accusatory.

### Google
- **Rating:** 5.0 stars (117 reviews) — strong reputation.
- **Takeaway:** Don't need to reference Google; keeps email to lead follow-up only. No lead-response review to cite.

## Template used
**Template A** — "I enquired and you didn't call back" only. No review quotes. Frame IntelliDial as the way to make sure every AutoTrader enquiry gets a call (and can book a viewing/appointment).

## Email draft — SEND THIS ONE

**Subject:** my Ford Fiesta ST enquiry on AutoTrader

Hi Martin,

I enquired about your 2015 Ford Fiesta ST on AutoTrader on 18 February — no callback.

You're "View By Appointment" with 6 cars on AutoTrader — every enquiry that slips through is a missed appointment and a missed sale. I built IntelliDial to fix exactly this: it calls your leads back within 60 seconds, even at 2am when nobody's at the desk. AI qualifies the buyer, answers questions about the car, and books an appointment straight into your calendar. You get a notification with the qualified lead and confirmed time slot. Just forward the leads email to us.

Happy to show you a 60-second demo — interested?

## Alternate subject lines

| Subject | Notes |
|---------|-------|
| `my Ford Fiesta ST enquiry on AutoTrader` | **Recommended** — specific, low-key |
| `Ford Fiesta ST enquiry — no callback` | More direct |
| `6 AutoTrader leads — every one could get a call in 60 sec` | Bold; use in follow-up if you want to be more direct |

## Follow-up schedule

| When | Action |
|------|--------|

## Notes
- **"View By Appointment"** — Their blurb says view by appointment; IntelliDial fits as "call back fast and book the viewing" so no enquiry slips before they can schedule.
- **6 cars, 4.5★ AutoTrader, 5.0★ Google** — Small, well-rated dealer. Tone is factual (I enquired, no callback) not attack. Kraaifontein / Zoo Park — Cape Town area, same dealer pool as your other emails.
