## Research summary

### AutoTrader
- **Rating:** No recent ratings (listing shows "no recent ratings").
- **Listings:** 21 cars. "Welcome to Autolink Knysna, at 35 Years old we are the most established pre-owned car dealership in Knysna. We specialize in quality used cars that are..."
- **Takeaway:** No AutoTrader review to quote — angle is your own enquiry (no callback) + 21 cars / 35 years = every lead matters.

### Google
- **Rating:** 4.8 stars (41 reviews).
- **Lowest reviews** (Benita Ayford, etc.) focus on **post-sale** issues: brakes, tyres, trade-in dispute. Not lead follow-up.
- **Takeaway:** Don't reference Google in this email — keep angle to lead response only. No "no callback" review to cite.

---

## Template used
**Template A** — "I enquired and you didn't call back" only. No review quotes (AutoTrader has no recent ratings; Google lowest are post-sale). Frame IntelliDial as the way to make sure every one of their 21 AutoTrader leads gets a call.

## Email draft — SEND THIS ONE

**Subject:** my Mercedes GLA enquiry on AutoTrader

```
Hi Autolink team,

I enquired about your 2015 Mercedes-Benz GLA GLA200CDI on AutoTrader on 18 February — no callback.

With 21 cars on AutoTrader and 35 years in Knysna, every lead that slips through is a missed sale. I built IntelliDial to fix exactly this — it calls your leads back within 60 seconds, day or night, weekends included. AI qualifies the buyer, answers questions about the car, and books a test drive straight into your calendar. You get a notification with the qualified lead, confirmed time slot, and full call transcript. You just forward the leads email to us.

Worth a look for Autolink?

| `Mercedes GLA GLA200CDI enquiry — no callback` | More direct |
| `21 AutoTrader leads — every one could get a call in 60 sec` | Bold; use in follow-up if you want to be more direct |

## Notes
- **No AutoTrader reviews to quote** — "no recent ratings" on their listing. Email relies on your own enquiry (no callback) + 21 cars / 35 years. Keeps tone factual, not accusatory.
- **Google 4.8★** — strong overall; lowest reviews are post-sale (brakes, tyres, trade-in). Don't reference them; angle is lead follow-up only.
- **Knysna** — Garden Route; same Western Cape dealer pool as your other emails. 35 years = established, every lead matters.
