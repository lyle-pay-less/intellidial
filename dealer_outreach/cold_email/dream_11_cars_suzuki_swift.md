## Research summary

### AutoTrader
- **Rating:** 3.6 stars (19 reviewers) — 69% five-star, 5% three-star, **26% one-star**.
- **Reviews:** Visible reviews are positive: Zane K (28 Oct 2025), 4.5★ "Awesome experience" — "Absolutely fantastic service and friendly from Arsene"; AutoTrader Customer (3 Dec 2025) "respond very quickly on questions and concerns"; Andre S (19 Jan 2026), 5★ "Communication was spot on, no issues at all" — Arsene; Franzio F (24 Jan 2026), 5★ "Excellent service". **26% 1-star** (~5 reviewers) but **no "no response" quote visible** in the screenshot.
- **Takeaway:** Mixed picture — strong positive feedback on Arsene and quick response; a sizeable minority are 1-star (often follow-up/communication). **No Template B** — don't invent a quote. Use **Template A only**: your no-callback + "even when you're on the ball, leads slip through when someone's busy or it's after hours" + IntelliDial so every lead gets a call. 8 cars, INTEGRITY / HONESTY / TRANSPARENCY, Approved Pre-Owned, 111-point check (Facebook).

### Google
- **Rating:** 5.0 stars (2 reviews). Shop 28, Village Centre, 4 Iris St, Gordons Bay Central, Cape Town 7151. Phone 061 475 1661, dream11cars.co.za. Opens 9 am Mon.
- **Takeaway:** Don't need to reference Google; lead with your experience and the product.

### Facebook
- Address 44 Swartvlei Street, Lemoenkloof, Paarl. Email bnan@dream11cars.co.za. "We sell good used vehicles, that have a 111 point check done." Not yet rated (0 reviews).
- **Takeaway:** brian@ from website is primary; bnan@ may be same person (typo).

## Template used
**Template A only** — "I enquired and you didn't call back." No quote from their reviews (visible ones praise Arsene and quick response; 26% 1-star but no usable "no response" snippet). Angle: your missed callback + "even when you're on the ball, leads slip through when someone's busy or it's after hours" + IntelliDial calls every lead back in 60 seconds so nobody slips through.

**Subject:** my Suzuki Swift GA enquiry on AutoTrader

Hi Dream 11 Cars team,

I enquired about your 2022 Suzuki Swift 1.2 GA on AutoTrader on 19 February — no callback.

I see you're big on integrity and your reviews mention quick response and great communication. Even so, leads slip through when someone's busy or it's after hours. I built IntelliDial to catch those: we call your leads back within 60 seconds, day or night, weekends included. AI qualifies the buyer, answers questions about the car, and books a viewing straight into your calendar. You get a notification with a qualified warm lead and a confirmed time slot — no lead left waiting.

Would a quick walkthrough be worth 2 minutes of your time?

| **Day 14** | Breakup: "Last note from me. If speed-to-lead isn't a priority now, no worries. If things change, I'm here." |

## Notes
- **brian@ vs bnan@** — Contact page lists brian@dream11cars.co.za; Facebook lists bnan@ (likely typo for brian). Use brian@ first; try bnan@ if bounce or no reply.
- **26% 1-star on AutoTrader** — Suggests some follow-up/communication issues but no explicit "no response" quote visible; keep Template A only, don't fabricate.
- **Arsene** — Mentioned positively in reviews (quick, friendly); don't attack — frame IntelliDial as backup so every lead gets a call when team is busy.
- **8 cars, Paarl / Gordons Bay** — Two locations (Paarl primary on contact/Facebook, Gordons Bay on Google); 111-point check, "Family of Integrity."
