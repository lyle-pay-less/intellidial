## Research summary

### AutoTrader
This is the **worst AutoTrader review profile in the entire batch.** Nearly every review is about the same thing: no response.

- **AutoTrader Customer** (25 Mar 2025), 0.5 stars: "No one has contacted me regarding my inquiry."
- **Adrian M** (13 Nov 2024), 0.5 stars, *"No reply to query"*: "Shocker"
- **Nico S** (10 Jun 2025), 0.5 stars, *"No response."*: "I contacted them twice for details of the vehicle, with a promise to send it straight away. Still waiting."
- **Todd G** (12 Aug 2025), 0.5 stars, *"No response"*: "Still no response"
- **Rey K** (27 Nov 2025), 0.5 stars, *"No contact"*: "No contact was made or feedback"
- **Hendrik B** (26 Aug 2025), 1 star, *"No service at al"*: "I phoned a couple of times, WhatsApped and emailed them about a bakkie, and they never got back to me."
- **AutoTrader Customer** (15 Sep 2025), 1 star: "Non existent No response to my request"
- **AutoTrader Customer** (8 Oct 2025), 1 star, *"No Reply Twice"*: "Send them a request on a vehicle twice with no reply. Their loss and BMW Umhlanga was absolutely next level!!"
- **AutoTrader Customer** (25 Jun 2025), 1 star: "Very slow, still waiting for answers after 5 days."

- **Takeaway:** 8+ reviews over the past year, all saying the exact same thing — no contact, no response, no callback. One buyer even says they went to a competitor (BMW Umhlanga). This dealer is haemorrhaging leads publicly.

### Google
- **Rating:** 4.4 stars (33 reviews). Facebook: 3.7/5 (3 votes).
- **Elias Wechsung** (1 star, ~1 year ago): "This place is terrible, customer care is non existent and they sell vehicles that are not maintained properly."
- **Takeaway:** Google is kinder but still has service complaints. The AutoTrader profile is the real story.

### Key insight
This dealer is paying for AutoTrader listings but responding to **almost none** of the leads. Every single bad review is specifically about not being contacted. One buyer literally went to BMW Umhlanga instead. The money they're spending on listings is being wasted.

## Email draft — SEND THIS ONE

**Subject:** my Evoque enquiry on AutoTrader

```
Hi Auto Agents team,

I enquired about your Range Rover Evoque D200 on AutoTrader on 11 February — no callback.

Looking at your AutoTrader reviews, this is a pattern — multiple buyers over the past year saying the same thing. One even went to another dealer. Every one of those is a lost sale on a car you're already paying to advertise.

I built Intellidial to fix exactly this. It calls your leads back within 60 seconds — even while your whole team is off. AI qualifies the buyer, answers questions about the car, and books a viewing into your calendar. You get a notification: qualified warm lead, confirmed time slot. No app, no system changes.

Worth a look for Auto Agents?

## Alternate subject lines

| Subject | Notes |
|---------|-------|
| `my Evoque enquiry on AutoTrader` | **Recommended** — specific, low-key |
| `Range Rover Evoque enquiry — no callback` | More direct |
| `your AutoTrader leads` | Short, vague enough to create curiosity |

## Follow-up schedule

| When | Action |
|------|--------|
| **Day 3** | Bump: "Just floating this to the top in case it got buried. Happy to close the loop if it's not relevant." |
| **Day 7** | Send Loom demo link (90-second walkthrough). |
| **Day 14** | Breakup: "Last note from me. If speed-to-lead isn't a priority now, no worries. If things change, I'm here." |

## Notes
- **8+ identical "no response" reviews is extraordinary.** No other dealer in the batch comes close. This is either a dealer who genuinely can't keep up, or one who doesn't check their AutoTrader leads at all.
- **Risk:** If they don't reply to buyers, they might not reply to you either. But the email is still worth sending — it costs you 5 minutes.
- **The BMW Umhlanga line** ("Their loss and BMW Umhlanga was absolutely next level!!") is referenced indirectly: "One even wrote that they went to another dealer instead." Don't name the competitor — keep it about them.
- **"Every one of those is a lost sale on a car you're already paying to advertise"** — this is the cost framing. They're spending money on AutoTrader listings and getting zero return because they don't follow up. That should sting.
- **Gmail address + cell number** = very small operation. Could be a one-person shop. If they DO respond, the decision maker is right there.
