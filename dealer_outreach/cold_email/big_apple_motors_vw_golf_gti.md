## Research summary

### AutoTrader
- **Rating:** 3.8 stars (3 reviewers). Visible reviews are all 5-star: Sam B "Best dealer in the business!" "Hands down for a dealer that goes over and beyond"; Chante S "Phenomenal sales team"; AutoTrader Customer "Great service... 10/10".
- **Listings:** 19 cars. "Quality Used Car Dealer in Parow & Goodwood, Cape Town since 2003. Welcome to Parow's Best Pre-owned, Big Apple Motors."
- **Takeaway:** No AutoTrader "no response" review to quote — angle is your own enquiry (no callback) only. Strong reputation when they respond; 19 cars = every lead matters.

### Google
- **Rating:** 3.8 stars (180 reviews). Used car dealer, Cape Town. Positive reviews name **Zee** ("amazing through out the purchasing experience") and **Mo** ("go out of his way to help").
- **Lowest reviews** (Antonio Daniels, Liesl Adriaanse, Raydene Baxter) are about **post-sale**: repairs, refunds, vehicle faults, management — not lead follow-up.
- **Takeaway:** Don't reference Google lowest in this email — keeps angle to lead response only. No "no response to enquiry" review to cite.

## Template used
**Template A** — "I enquired and you didn't call back" only. No review quotes (AutoTrader shows only positive; Google lowest are post-sale). Frame IntelliDial as the way to make sure every one of their 19 AutoTrader enquiries gets a call.

## Email draft — SEND THIS ONE

**Subject:** my Golf GTI enquiry on AutoTrader

```
Hi Sam,

I enquired about your 2017 Volkswagen Golf GTI Auto on AutoTrader on 18 February — no callback.

With 19 cars on AutoTrader and Parow & Goodwood since 2003, every enquiry that slips through is a missed sale. I built Intellidial to fix exactly this: it calls your leads back within 60 seconds, even at 2am when nobody's at the desk. AI qualifies the buyer, answers questions about the car, and books a viewing into your calendar. You get a notification with a qualified warm lead and a confirmed time slot.

Just forward the leads email to us — every lead gets a call.

Happy to show you a 60-second demo — interested?

## Notes
- **No AutoTrader "no response" review** — AutoTrader shows only 5★ (Sam B, Chante S, AutoTrader Customer). Email relies on your own enquiry (no callback) + 19 cars. Tone is factual, not accusatory.
- **Sam (General Sales)** — Primary contact; greet "Hi Sam." Zee and Mo are named in positive Google reviews; use for follow-up or CC if no reply.
- **19 cars, since 2003** — Parow & Goodwood. Every lead matters. Cape Town dealer pool.
