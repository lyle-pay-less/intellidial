## Research summary

### AutoTrader
- **Rating:** 2.7 stars (6 reviewers) — 66% one-star, 17% five-star, 17% three-star. Polarised.
- **Reviews used for angle:**
  - **Selma** (27 Jan 2025), 2.5 stars: *"I didn't get what I need"* — content not detailed. Dealer reply (25 Mar 2025): "Good day Selma, please advise what you need so that we can source what you need and that we can better our service."
  - **Hajiera B** (25 Mar 2025), 5 stars: "Amazing experience" — manager and salesman "exceptional service." Shows they can deliver when the process works.
- **Takeaway:** Dealer is aware of gaps ("better our service") and wants to improve. Selma's "I didn't get what I need" is vague but fits a pattern of unmet expectations. Strong angle: "every lead gets a call so nobody falls through — and you can actually deliver on 'better our service'."

### Google
- **Rating:** 3.7 stars (72 reviews).
- **Lowest reviews** (Suren Pillay, Anthony Cundari, Nicolette Darlow) focus on **post-sale** issues: license/plates delays, engine light, wheel/body issues, warranty and repair disputes. Not lead follow-up.
- **Takeaway:** Don't lean on Google for this email — those complaints are about after-sale, not speed-to-lead. Stick to AutoTrader angle and your own enquiry (no callback).

## Template used
**Template A + B** — "I enquired and you didn't call back" + AutoTrader 2.7 stars and Selma's "I didn't get what I need" + their reply about "better our service." Frame IntelliDial as the tool that helps them deliver on that promise.

## Email draft — SEND THIS ONE

**Subject:** my Mercedes-AMG CLA enquiry on AutoTrader

```
Hi Auto One Motors team,

I enquired about your 2015 Mercedes-AMG CLA45 4Matic on AutoTrader on 18 February — no callback.

I noticed a review on your AutoTrader page: "I didn't get what I need." Your team replied that you want to "better our service." That's exactly what I built a fix for — so every lead gets a response before they leave a review like that.

Intellidial calls your leads back within 60 seconds — even at 9pm on a Friday. AI qualifies the buyer, answers questions about the car, and books a viewing into your calendar. You get a notification: qualified warm lead, confirmed time slot.

Would a quick walkthrough be worth 2 minutes of your time?

## Alternate subject lines

| Subject | Notes |
|---------|-------|
| `my Mercedes-AMG CLA enquiry on AutoTrader` | **Recommended** — specific, low-key |
| `Mercedes-AMG CLA45 enquiry — no callback` | More direct |
| `Better our service — I built a fix for lead follow-up` | Ties to their own reply; use if you want to be more direct |

## Follow-up schedule

| When | Action |
|------|--------|
| **Day 3** | Bump: "Just floating this to the top in case it got buried. Happy to close the loop if it's not relevant." |
| **Day 7** | Send Loom demo link (90-second walkthrough). Mention: "13 listings on AutoTrader — every one of those leads could get a call in 60 seconds." |
| **Day 14** | Breakup: "Last note from me. If speed-to-lead isn't a priority now, no worries. If things change, I'm here." |

## Notes
- **Google reviews** are mostly post-sale (license, engine, warranty). Don't reference them in this email — keeps the angle clean (lead follow-up only).
- **Selma + dealer reply** — "I didn't get what I need" + "please advise what you need... we can better our service" gives you a constructive angle: you're not attacking, you're offering the tool that helps them deliver on "better our service."
- **13 results** on AutoTrader — small inventory, so every lead matters. Mention in follow-up #2 if useful.
- **Goodwood** — same Cape Town dealer pool as your other cold emails.
