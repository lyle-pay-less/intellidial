## Research summary

### AutoTrader
- **Robyn S** (4 Feb 2026), 0.5 stars, *"Over promise no delivery"*: "They advertise vehicles they dont have, been waiting since 9th of january and now owner has ghosted me after telling me last week he was busy with recon on the vehicle. Turns out the vehicle doesnt even exist. Eish!"
- **Takeaway:** Very recent review (2 weeks ago). Pattern of poor follow-up and ghosting buyers. Owner is directly involved in sales — small operation.

### Google
- **Denise Alexander** (1 star, ~1 month ago): "Not very helpful."
- **Takeaway:** Consistent poor-service signal across both platforms.

### Overall assessment
- This is a smaller dealer — likely owner-operated or very small team.
- The Robyn S review is devastating: buyer waited a month, got ghosted, car didn't exist.
- **Angle:** Don't reference the fake-listing issue (that's a different problem and could feel like an attack). Focus on the ghosting / slow follow-up angle — the owner clearly can't keep up with enquiries himself.

## Email draft — SEND THIS ONE

**Subject:** my Amarok enquiry on AutoTrader

```
Hi MVP Auto team,

I enquired about your VW Amarok 3.0TDi on AutoTrader on 11 February — no callback.

I know running a dealership means you're pulled in a hundred directions, and leads slip through. That's exactly what I built a fix for.

Intellidial calls your AutoTrader leads back within 60 seconds — any hour, any day. AI qualifies the buyer, answers their questions about the car, and books a viewing into your calendar. You get a notification with a qualified warm lead and a confirmed time slot.

Forward your leads email to us and we call immediately. No app, no system changes.

Worth a look for MVP Auto?

| **Day 7** | Send Loom demo link (90-second walkthrough). |
| **Day 14** | Breakup: "Last note from me. If speed-to-lead isn't a priority now, no worries. If things change, I'm here." |

## Notes
- **Do NOT reference the Robyn S review** about the non-existent vehicle. That's a trust/integrity issue, not a speed-to-lead issue. Bringing it up would feel like an attack and they'd get defensive.
- **Do NOT reference Google reviews** — "not very helpful" is too vague to use as an angle.
- **Tone is empathetic, not confrontational.** Small dealer, likely overwhelmed. Position Intellidial as help, not a finger-wag.
- If owner-operated, the owner IS the decision maker — a reply from anyone = a reply from the boss.
