## Research summary

### AutoTrader
- **Rating:** **2.6 stars (58 reviews)** — low; strong no-response pattern.
- **Reviews used for angle:**
  - **Gerardo C** (20 Dec 2024), 0.5★: *"No response. Sent an enquiry, they didnt bother to reply."*
  - **Hassan B** (17 Mar 2025), 0.5★: *"didnt respongd. SUBPAR."*
  - **Adrian M** (11 Aug 2025), 0.5★: "He phoned me while he was driving and I never heard back from them." Dealer reply (13 Aug): "called back no answer..."
  - **Gareth B** (4 Jun 2025), 0.5★ re 2019 BMW M2: *"no reply nothing...."*
  - **AutoTrader Customer** (19 Jun 2025), 0.5★: *"No experience! no one responded than thanking me of making contact! Can't complain about the service.... there wasn't any!!"* Dealer reply: "this client was called(no answer) and whats appd."
  - **Dave** (24 Feb 2025), 1★: *"No feedback".*
  - **Bradley E** (14 Mar 2025), 1★: *"They didn't call back."* Dealer reply: "We tried contacting client . Client never answered".
- **Takeaway:** Repeated "no response," "didn't reply," "never heard back," "no reply nothing," "no one responded," "No feedback," "They didn't call back." Dealer often blames "no answer" / "client never answered" — IntelliDial = every lead gets a call so no missed connections. 81 cars, N1 City, established 2014. Strong fit for IntelliDial.

### Google
- **Rating:** 4.6 stars (80 reviews). 6 Manus Gerber St, N1 City, Cape Town 7460. Phone 087 896 9192. Opens 8:30 am Mon. No email on listing.
- **Takeaway:** Don't reference Google; AutoTrader reviews are the clearest and most damaging — use those.

## Template used
**Template A + B** — "I enquired and you didn't call back" + Gerardo C ("No response. Sent an enquiry, they didnt bother to reply") + Hassan B / Adrian M / AutoTrader Customer ("didnt respongd", "I never heard back from them", "no one responded"). Frame IntelliDial as the fix so every lead gets a call in 60 seconds — no more "called back no answer" or "client never answered" when the lead is ready.

## Email draft — SEND THIS ONE

**Subject:** my Kia Seltos EX+ enquiry on AutoTrader

```
Hi Keegan,

I enquired about your 2022 Kia Seltos 1.6 EX+ on AutoTrader on 19 February — no callback.

I noticed an AutoTrader review: "Sent an enquiry, they didnt bother to reply." Your team's reply on another was "called back no answer" — that timing gap is exactly what I built IntelliDial to close. We call your leads back within 60 seconds, even at 2am when nobody's at the desk. AI qualifies the buyer, answers questions about the car, and books a test drive straight into your calendar. You get a notification with a qualified warm lead and a confirmed time slot — no more missed connections.

Happy to show you a 60-second demo — interested?
