## Research summary

### AutoTrader reviews
- **AutoTrader Customer** (24 Oct 2024), 0.5 stars, *"Disappointed"*: "I am disappointed I never received a call from them after I made enquiry and still waiting.." Dealer response (6 Feb 2025 — over 3 months later!): "Apologies for the experience you received. This is definitely not the type of service we aim to provide. We are looking into our process to ensure that this will never happen again."
- **Kgotsofalo kgetho P** (17 Mar 2025), 1 star, *"Bad reception"*: "The lady was cold and couldn't assist any any way..." Dealer response same day: "Could I ask you to call and ask for Blake and I will personally to try assist."
- **Takeaway:** Dealer is aware of lead follow-up failures and has publicly apologised. Their own words — "looking into our process to ensure this will never happen again" — is the perfect opening for Intellidial.

Hi Blake,

I enquired about your Jetour Dashing 1.5T on AutoTrader on 11 February — no callback.

I noticed one of your AutoTrader review replies says you're "looking into your process to ensure this will never happen again." I actually built the fix for exactly this.

Intellidial calls your leads back within 60 seconds — day or night, weekends included. AI qualifies the buyer, answers questions about the car, and books a test drive. You get a full call transcript and sentiment analysis for every lead. Just forward the leads email to us; no system changes needed.

Would a quick walkthrough be worth 2 minutes of your time?

## Follow-up schedule

| When | Action |
|------|--------|
| **Day 3** | Bump: "Just floating this to the top in case it got buried. Happy to close the loop if it's not relevant." |
| **Day 7** | Send Loom demo link (90-second walkthrough). If no reply from main contact, CC Blake (mentioned in review responses — appears to be senior). |
| **Day 14** | Breakup: "Last note from me. If speed-to-lead isn't a priority now, no worries. If things change, I'm here." |
