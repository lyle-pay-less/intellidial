# Campaign Feedback — Honest Assessment (22 Feb 2026)

## Success Rating: 7/10 — will likely get pilots. Paying customers less certain.

---

## Why I'm optimistic (the 7)

**Positioning is genuinely strong.** Not cold emailing strangers. Made real enquiries, got ignored, emailing as the lead they missed. That framing is rare and powerful. Most dealers who open this will read at least to the second line because it looks like a complaint from a buyer they dropped.

**The research is real.** Quoting their exact AutoTrader reviews, naming their salespeople, referencing their "called back no answer" replies -- this doesn't look like a template. It looks like someone who actually cared enough to check. Ahead of 95% of software outreach they receive.

**Product-market fit is obvious.** Don't need to convince dealers they have a problem. Their own customers are screaming it in public reviews. Dart Motors (1.6 stars, "NOT following up leads"), Cubbi (relentless no-response), Exclusive Auto Group ("didnt bother to reply"), F&S Auto ("phone rings with no answer") -- these dealers are bleeding money.

**Realistic numbers from 35 sends:**

| Metric | Conservative | Likely | Optimistic |
|--------|-------------|--------|------------|
| Opens | 60% (21) | 75% (26) | 85% (30) |
| Replies (incl. follow-ups) | 12% (4) | 20% (7) | 28% (10) |
| "Tell me more" conversations | 2-3 | 4-5 | 6-8 |
| Demo calls | 1-2 | 2-3 | 4-5 |
| Pilots | 1 | **2-3** | 4 |

**2-3 pilots is the most likely outcome.**

## Why not a 9 (the honest part)

**1. Bait-and-switch risk.** Some dealers will open thinking "missed buyer" and feel tricked when it's software. Maybe 10-20% react negatively. Emails handle the transition well but some will still feel played.

**2. Worst-reviewed dealers might be worst customers.** Dart Motors (1.6), F&S Auto (2.4), Exclusive Auto Group (2.6) -- strongest emails because reviews are damning. But dealers with worst follow-up are often worst at adopting new tools. The 3.5-4.5 star ones who care about service but occasionally miss leads are most likely to become paying customers.

**3. Is the product ready to demo?** When a dealer replies "show me," need to demo within 24 hours. If can't show real call > qualify > Calendly booking > notification flow, conversation dies.

**4. Warmup is young (6 days).** If bad address bounces or Gmail flags, deliverability tanks before half the list is sent.

**5. Pilots are not customers.** Getting 2-3 dealers to try free is achievable. Getting them to pay requires product to work and them to see enough value.

## 10 Tips to Improve Chances

### Before sending

1. **Have a working demo ready NOW.** Record a Loom of a real call -- lead enquires, phone rings in 60 seconds, AI talks, booking appears in Calendly, notification pops up with transcript. This Loom is the Day 7 follow-up weapon.

2. **Know your price before anyone asks.** "Free for the first month, then R1,500/month" is better than "let me get back to you." Hesitation kills deals.

3. **Set up SPF, DKIM, DMARC for intellidial.co.za.** Check at mail-tester.com. Score below 8/10 = fix before sending.

### When sending

4. **Send strongest Template A+B first (days 1-5).** Cubbi, Dart Motors, Exclusive Auto Group, Autodrome, Auto Monarch, Carmichael Xtreme. Early replies = good sender reputation = better deliverability.

5. **Send Tuesday-Thursday, 8:00-9:30 AM.** Dealers open 8:00-8:30. Monday is catch-up. Friday they're checked out.

### When they reply

6. **Reply within 5 minutes.** Selling speed-to-lead -- if reply takes 6 hours, proved you don't practice what you preach.

7. **Use WhatsApp for SA dealers.** Day 7 follow-up via WhatsApp is more natural than email #3 in SA.

### After the pilot

8. **Get ONE testimonial from first pilot.** Even "IntelliDial called our lead back in 47 seconds and booked a viewing" -- one line of social proof transforms every future email.

9. **Track pilot conversion rate.** "We called 15 leads, booked 8 viewings, 3 showed up, 1 bought" -- that story turns pilot into paying customer.

10. **Ask for referrals.** SA dealers know other dealers. "Do you know another dealer who'd want this?" One warm intro > 10 cold emails.

## Bottom line

Research, positioning, and email quality are genuinely good -- better than most first outreach campaigns. Emails will open. Some will reply. Conversations will happen. Whether those become pilots depends on the demo. Whether pilots become customers depends on the product. The emails are doing their job -- make sure the product is ready when the door opens.

## Follow-up: Loom + ZeroBounce + 2 more days warmup (22 Feb 2026)

**Question:** What if I make my Loom video for the demo, use ZeroBounce before sending, and let warmup run another 2 days -- does that improve the 7/10?

| Action | Impact | Rating bump |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| **Loom demo ready** | **High** | +1 full point |
| **ZeroBounce verification** | **Medium-high** | +0.5 |
| **2 more days warmup (8 days total)** | **Low** | +0.25 |

**Loom demo (+1 point):** Single biggest thing you can do. Email gets the door open, but when someone replies "show me" and there's nothing to send, conversation dies in 48 hours. A 60-90 second Loom showing: lead enquires > phone rings in 60 seconds > AI talks > Calendly booking appears > notification with transcript -- that turns "interesting" into "when can we start?" Alone moves from 7 to 8.

**ZeroBounce (+0.5):** Running all 35 addresses through ZeroBounce eliminates bounces. Zero bounces = clean sender reputation from day one. One bad bounce in first 5 sends can tank Instantly deliverability for the whole campaign. Cheap insurance. Especially important for guessed addresses (danny@durbellautos.co.za, deon@dscars.co.za, Ridah@exclusiveag.co.za, etc.) -- verify or drop.

**2 more days warmup (+0.25):** Marginal. 6 vs 8 days doesn't materially change deliverability. Real threshold is ~14 days. At 2-3 emails/day starting Tuesday 25 Feb (day 8), within safe limits. Warmup keeps running alongside real sends. Don't delay for this.

**Updated rating with all three: 7 -> 8/10**

The 2 points still missing (8 to 10) come from things you can't control yet: whether the product performs in the real world, whether the first pilot dealer engages, and whether "free trial" converts to "paying customer." Those points get earned in weeks 3-6, not in the emails.

## The verdict

After doing all of this -- 100 real enquiries, deep research on every dealer, hyper-personalised emails with their own review quotes, finding decision-maker contacts, ZeroBounce verification, Loom demo ready, Instantly warmup, proper send pacing -- **yes, you've done everything within your control to give yourself the best chance of success.**

The outreach side is covered. The emails are strong. The targeting is sharp. The deliverability is being handled properly. There's nothing left to optimise on the email side that would meaningfully change your odds.

What's left is execution:
- **Record the Loom** (before Tuesday)
- **ZeroBounce the list** (Monday)
- **Start sending** (Tuesday morning, strongest dealers first)
- **Reply fast** when they respond (within 5 minutes)
- **Close the pilot** on the call (have pricing ready)
- **Deliver results** so the pilot becomes a customer

You've built the best hand you can. Now play it.
