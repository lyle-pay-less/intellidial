## Research summary

### AutoTrader
- **Rating:** 4 stars (13 reviews) — 84% five-star, 8% one-star.
- **sandiso d** (1 Oct 2025), 0.5 stars, *"Horrible"*: **"No response at all."**  
  **Dealer reply (2 Oct):** "Hi Sandi, we apologize that the response hasn't reached you. **We have tried to call and responded via WhatsApp**"
- **Takeaway:** Same pattern as A.M.A Auto and others — they *try* to respond (call, WhatsApp) but the response "hasn't reached" the customer. So they care, but leads still slip through or get lost. Intellidial = one place to send leads, we call within 60 seconds — no "tried to call, responded via WhatsApp" gap.

### Google
- **Rating:** 4.6 stars (9 reviews).
- **Takeaway:** In-person reputation is strong; online lead follow-up is the weak link (same as other dealers in the batch).

## Template used
**Template B** — Their own review reply ("we have tried to call and responded via WhatsApp" but response didn’t reach) shows they want to respond but have a process gap. You’re offering the fix.

## Email draft — SEND THIS ONE

**Subject:** my Toyota Corolla Quest enquiry on AutoTrader

```
Hi Amazen Auto team,

I enquired about your 2017 Toyota Corolla Quest 1.6 Plus on AutoTrader on 16 February — no callback.

I saw your reply to a recent AutoTrader review where you'd tried to call and WhatsApp, but the response hadn't reached the customer. That's a process gap, not a service gap — and it's exactly what I built a fix for.

Intellidial calls your leads back within 60 seconds — even while your whole team is off. AI qualifies the buyer, answers questions about the car, and books a viewing into your calendar. You get a notification: qualified warm lead, confirmed time slot. No leads depend on WhatsApp or a missed call.

Worth a look for Amazen Auto?

| **Day 7** | Send Loom demo link (90-second walkthrough). |
| **Day 14** | Breakup: "Last note from me. If speed-to-lead isn't a priority now, no worries. If things change, I'm here." |

## Notes
- **Knysna, not Cape Town** — they’re on the Garden Route. If you mention location, "Amazen Auto in Knysna" is enough; no need to stress distance.
- **Their reply is the angle.** "We have tried to call and responded via WhatsApp" = they’re trying but the response doesn’t reach. You’re not accusing them; you’re offering a single, reliable channel so every lead gets a call.
- **Tasmiya Nagdee** (LinkedIn) — if you find an email or want to try InMail, you could use "Hi Tasmiya," and reference their role. For now, info@ and "Amazen Auto team" are fine.
- **Email domain:** You gave info@amazenauto.com; if their site uses .co.za, use info@amazenauto.co.za instead.
