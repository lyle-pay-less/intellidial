## Research summary

### AutoTrader
- **Rating:** 3.2 stars (17 reviews) — 53% five-star, **35% one-star.** Polarised.
- **Recent no-response reviews:**
  - **Christiaan B** (9 Jan 2026), 1 star, *"Bad service"*: "No reply from the dealer"
  - **AutoTrader Customer** (12 Dec 2025), 1 star: "Never heard from them"
  - **AutoTrader Customer** (21 Nov 2025), 1 star: "No return on my request, positive or negative"
  - **aron j** (5 Aug 2025), 0.5 stars: "They just responded once.. When I ask for location then they stopped responding"
  - **Mesuli A** (4 Aug 2025), 0.5 stars: "No contact was made after i submitted an enquiry" — **Dealer replied (5 Aug):** "hi there, pop me another whatsapp will make sure to reply"
  - **NISH** (31 Jul 2025), 1 star: "No response"
- **Positive:** shermel j (4 Dec 2025), 3 stars, *"Friendly staff"*: "No complaints, they attended to me very quickly. Very friendly guys"
- **Takeaway:** Dealer is aware of the problem — they replied to Mesuli A saying "pop me another whatsapp will make sure to reply." So they know leads slip through and suggest WhatsApp. That’s a process gap, not indifference. Small operation (6 listings, appointment-based, "Closed" on AutoTrader). Intellidial = one place to send leads, we call immediately — no "pop me another whatsapp" needed.

### Google
- **Rating:** 5.0 stars (8 reviews) — much better than AutoTrader.
- **"Add website"** suggested — likely no website; phone/WhatsApp/AutoTrader are main channels.
- **Takeaway:** In-person experience is strong; online lead follow-up is the weak link. Same angle as Autostyling CPT — compliment in-person, fix the online gap.

## Template used
**Template A + B** — Your enquiry (24 hours, no response) + their own review reply ("pop me another whatsapp") shows they know leads slip through and are open to fixing it.

## Email draft — SEND THIS ONE

**Subject:** my Toyota Hilux enquiry on AutoTrader

```
Hi A.M.A Auto team,

I enquired about your 2017 Toyota Hilux 2.4GD on AutoTrader last night (16 February) — 24 hours later, no callback.

I saw one of your AutoTrader review replies where you asked the buyer to "pop me another whatsapp" so you could reply. That tells me you want to respond — the problem is leads slipping through before you get to them.

I built Intellidial to fix exactly that. We call your AutoTrader leads back within 60 seconds — even while your whole team is off. AI qualifies the buyer, answers questions about the bakkie, and books a viewing into your calendar. Forward the leads email to us — no more WhatsApp chasing.

Would this be useful for A.M.A Auto?

## Alternate subject lines

| Subject | Notes |
|---------|-------|
| `my Toyota Hilux enquiry on AutoTrader` | **Recommended** — specific, low-key |
| `Toyota Hilux 2.4GD — no callback` | More direct |
| `your AutoTrader leads` | Short, curiosity |

## Follow-up schedule

| When | Action |
|------|--------|
| **Day 3** | Bump: "Just floating this to the top in case it got buried. Happy to close the loop if it's not relevant." |
| **Day 7** | Send Loom demo link (90-second walkthrough). |
| **Day 14** | Breakup: "Last note from me. If speed-to-lead isn't a priority now, no worries. If things change, I'm here." If still no reply, try **phone (061 603 8679)** or WhatsApp — they've invited WhatsApp in a review reply. |

## Notes
- **Their own reply is the angle.** "Pop me another whatsapp will make sure to reply" = they know they miss leads and try to fix it with more channels. You're offering one channel that doesn’t depend on them remembering to check WhatsApp.
- **Small operation** — 6 listings, appointment-based, "Closed" often. They're not ignoring leads on purpose; they're overwhelmed or leads get lost. Tone = helpful, not accusatory.
- **No website** — email may be hard to find. If you can’t get an email, consider one polite WhatsApp: "Hi, I enquired on your Hilux on AutoTrader and also sent an email about a way to never miss a lead again — can I send the short version here or is there a better email to use?"
- **5.0 on Google vs 3.2 on AutoTrader** — same pattern as others: in-person good, online follow-up weak. Don’t lead with "your reviews are bad"; lead with "you want to reply, leads slip through, we fix that."
