## Research summary

### AutoTrader
- **Rating:** 3 stars (18 reviewers) — polarized: 44% five-star, 44% one-star.
- **Reviews used for angle:**
  - **Abigail L** (15 Jul 2025), 2 stars: *"Auto monarch never got back to me"*
  - **Le Roux B** (17 Sep 2025), 1 star: *"Inability to show the car"* — "The car was not on the floor for more than a week." Dealer reply: "Our sales consultant will contact you to make arrangements for you to view the vehicle."
- **Takeaway:** Clear pattern of no follow-up and broken promises to call back. Strong fit for speed-to-lead and "every lead gets a call."

### Google
- **Rating:** 4.1 stars (35 reviews).
- **Reviews used for angle:**
  - **Nizar Salie** (3 months ago), 1 star: *"Extremely Disappointed with the Service"* — Called Thursday about a vehicle; applied, got approved, ready to buy. Dealership prioritised another buyer who didn't show Friday. Promised a call Saturday — "never happened." Monday told they'd only be contacted if the other deal fell through. "Lack of communication and professionalism" — "I would not recommend doing business with this dealership."
  - **Frances Brannekamper** (1 year ago), 1 star: *"Nobody answers the phone!!"*
- **Takeaway:** Communication and phone follow-up are the core complaints. Frances's "Nobody answers the phone!!" is a direct fit for IntelliDial (voice AI answers when they can't).

## Template used
**Template A + B** — "I enquired and you didn't call back" + their own reviews (Abigail L "never got back to me", Frances "Nobody answers the phone"). The phone/communication angle is especially strong here.

## Email draft — SEND THIS ONE

**Subject:** my Mercedes C-Class enquiry on AutoTrader

```
Hi Auto Monarch team,

I enquired about your 2012 Mercedes-Benz C-Class C250CDI on AutoTrader on 18 February — no callback.

One of your Google reviews says it plainly: "Nobody answers the phone!!" That's a lost sale every time — a lead that just needed a call back.

I built Intellidial to fix exactly this. It calls your leads back within 60 seconds — even at 2am when nobody's at the desk. AI qualifies the buyer, answers questions about the car, and books a viewing into your calendar. You get a notification: qualified warm lead, confirmed time slot. No missed calls, no promises that slip through.

Happy to show you a 60-second demo — interested?

## Alternate subject lines

| Subject | Notes |
|---------|-------|
| `my Mercedes C-Class enquiry on AutoTrader` | **Recommended** — specific, low-key |
| `Mercedes C250CDI enquiry — no callback` | More direct |
| `Nobody answers the phone — I built a fix` | Bold — leads with their own review; use if you want to be more provocative |

## Follow-up schedule

| When | Action |
|------|--------|
| **Day 3** | Bump: "Just floating this to the top in case it got buried. Happy to close the loop if it's not relevant." |
| **Day 7** | Send Loom demo link (90-second walkthrough). Mention: "Especially for after-hours — when your team isn't there, the AI still answers and qualifies the lead." |
| **Day 14** | Breakup: "Last note from me. If speed-to-lead isn't a priority now, no worries. If things change, I'm here." |

## Notes
- **Frances's "Nobody answers the phone!!"** is the strongest single quote for IntelliDial — it's exactly what voice AI solves. You reference it in the email without naming her; keeps it professional.
- **Nizar Salie's story** (approved, promised Saturday call, never happened) is a lost-sale narrative. You summarise it in one line; don't name the reviewer to avoid sounding accusatory.
- **Strand location** — same Cape Town / Western Cape dealer pool as your other cold emails. Consistent with your lead response test geography.
