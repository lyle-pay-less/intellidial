## Research summary

### AutoTrader
- **Rating:** 3.6 stars (15 reviewers).
- **Reviews used for angle:**
  - **Jeremy N** (7 May 2025), 1★ *"very poor"* — left an enquiry via the website and a phone call **without receiving a reply**.
  - **Kirwin M** (5 Sep 2025), 1★ *"Lack of customer service"* — **"No contact."**
- **Other reviews:** Chad G (22 Oct 2024) 4.5★ "Excellent service with great response times"; Thabang M (23 Dec 2024) 4.5★ "Service was Excellent"; AutoTrader Customer (19 Nov 2025) 5★ "Very good service"; Jacques S (3 Dec 2025) 5★ "Excellent website".
- **Takeaway:** Jeremy N "enquiry via website and phone call without receiving a reply" and Kirwin M "No contact" are direct lead-follow-up complaints. Strong fit for IntelliDial. 20 cars, De La Haye / Bellville.

### Google
- **Rating:** 3.5 stars (25 reviews). 44 Strand Rd, Bellville, Cape Town 7530. Domain durbellautos.co.za. Owner replies to reviews; one reply gave **riko@durbellautos.co.za**. Some 1★ reviews mention after-sales (Marius/Maruis Stemmet, parcel tray, handover) — not lead follow-up; stick to AutoTrader angle.
- **Takeaway:** Use AutoTrader reviews for the email; riko@ is confirmed owner contact for follow-up.

## Template used
**Template A + B** — "I enquired and you didn't call back" + Jeremy N ("enquiry via website and phone call without receiving a reply") + Kirwin M ("No contact"). Frame IntelliDial as the fix so every lead gets a call — no more missed enquiries from website or AutoTrader.

## Email draft — SEND THIS ONE

**Subject:** my VW Polo 1.0TSI enquiry on AutoTrader

```
Hi Durbell Autos team,

I enquired about your 2023 VW Polo 1.0TSI 70kW on AutoTrader on 19 February — no callback.

I noticed a couple of your AutoTrader reviews: one buyer left an enquiry via the website and a phone call without receiving a reply; another simply said "No contact." I built IntelliDial to fix exactly this: we call your leads back within 60 seconds, even at 9pm on a Friday. AI qualifies the buyer, answers questions about the car, and books a viewing straight into your calendar. You get a notification with a qualified warm lead and a confirmed time slot — every enquiry handled, no more missed sales.

Would this be useful for Durbell Autos?

## Follow-up schedule

| When | Action |
|------|--------|
| **Day 3** | Bump: "Just floating this to the top in case it got buried. Happy to close the loop if it's not relevant." |
| **Day 7** | Send Loom demo link (90-second walkthrough). Mention: "20 cars on AutoTrader — every enquiry could get a call in 60 seconds, no more missed website or phone enquiries." If no reply to sales@, try **riko@durbellautos.co.za** (owner) or call 021 948 9180. |
| **Day 14** | Breakup: "Last note from me. If speed-to-lead isn't a priority now, no worries. If things change, I'm here." |
