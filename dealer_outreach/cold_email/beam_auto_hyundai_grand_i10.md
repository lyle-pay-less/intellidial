## Research summary

### AutoTrader
- **Rating:** 4.4 stars (66 reviewers).
- **Reviews used for angle:**
  - **Annie A** (16 Aug 2025), 1 star: *"No reply about basic safety questions"* — "Kept telling me they would answer my basic question about a safety feature of the car and **never got back to me** even after I reminded them several times. Why?" Dealer reply encouraged viewing in person.
  - **Curt R** (02 Dec 2025), 1 star: *"No communication"* — "I reached out via the auto trader platform to dealer with **no response received back as of yet**." Dealer reply (same day): "Please check your mails. We sent a mail on the 28th of November..."
  - **AutoTrader Customer** (30 Sep 2025), 1 star: "Very shady" — don't use; trust/scam angle, not lead follow-up.
- **Takeaway:** Annie A "never got back to me" and Curt R "no response received back" are direct lead-follow-up complaints. Strong fit for IntelliDial. 20 cars, VIEWINGS BY APPOINTMENT ONLY = every enquiry that slips through is a missed appointment.

### Google
- **Rating:** 4.4 stars (10 reviews). Somerset West. "Boutique-style car dealership... integrity, transparency, commitment." Positive reviews mention Ameer.
- **Takeaway:** Don't need to reference Google; AutoTrader reviews are the clearest lead-response angle. Their stated values (transparency, commitment) align with "every lead gets a call" — optional soft tie-in in follow-up.

## Template used
**Template A + B** — "I enquired and you didn't call back" + Annie A / Curt R ("never got back to me", "no response received back"). Frame IntelliDial as the fix so every lead gets a call — and they can keep their "viewings by appointment" model by booking the viewing in 60 seconds.

## Email draft — SEND THIS ONE

**Subject:** my Hyundai Grand i10 enquiry on AutoTrader

```
Hi Beam Auto team,

I enquired about your 2022 Hyundai Grand i10 1.0 Motion on AutoTrader on 18 February — no callback.

One of your AutoTrader reviews says you "never got back to me" even after several reminders. With 20 cars and viewings by appointment, every enquiry that slips through is a missed appointment — and a missed sale. I built IntelliDial to fix this: it calls your leads back within 60 seconds, even while your whole team is off. AI qualifies the buyer, answers questions about the car, and books a viewing into your calendar. You get a notification with the qualified warm lead and confirmed time slot. Just forward the leads email to us.

Can I show you what this looks like for one of your leads?

## Follow-up schedule

| When | Action |
|------|--------|
| **Day 3** | Bump: "Just floating this to the top in case it got buried. Happy to close the loop if it's not relevant." |
| **Day 7** | Send Loom demo link (90-second walkthrough). Mention: "20 cars, viewings by appointment — every AutoTrader enquiry could get a call and book a viewing in 60 seconds." Optional: "Fits with your transparency and commitment to service." |
| **Day 14** | Breakup: "Last note from me. If speed-to-lead isn't a priority now, no worries. If things change, I'm here." |

## Notes
- **Annie A + Curt R** — "Never got back to me" and "no response received back" are direct lead-follow-up complaints. Don't name reviewers; the pattern speaks for itself. Don't reference "Very shady" (AutoTrader Customer) — different angle.
- **VIEWINGS BY APPOINTMENT ONLY** — IntelliDial fits: call back in 60 seconds, qualify, book the viewing. No enquiry slips before they can schedule.
- **20 cars, 4.4★** — Boutique, Somerset West. Integrity / transparency / commitment on their site — "every lead gets a call" aligns; optional in follow-up.
- **Somerset West** — Cape Town area, same dealer pool as your other emails.
