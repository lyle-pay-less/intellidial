## Research summary

### AutoTrader
This is the **most extreme review profile in the entire outreach.** The reviews are relentless — almost all about the same thing: zero response.

**Recent (2026):**
- **Seb L** (28 Jan 2026), 0.5 stars, *"Lack of interest or response"*: "I waited two days after initial contact was made and still got zero response from Brandon. **I will not be buying a car from Cubbi now.**"
- **Luke T** (3 Feb 2026), 1 star: **"Never called me back!"** — posted the day after YOUR enquiry.
- **Shaune M** (6 Jan 2026), 1 star, *"Zero feedback"*: "Not even a msg to say they busy, closed for the holiday.....nothing"
- **AutoTrader Customer** (13 Jan 2026), 0.5 stars: "No one call3e" (no one called)
- **AutoTrader Customer** (21 Jan 2026), 0.5 stars, *"No response"*: "Receiving no response after various calls and emails"

**2025 — same pattern all year:**
- **Roy M** (6 Jan 2026), 0.5 stars, *"Clearly in no rush to make any sales"*: "No answers to Whatsapp for hours/days, no calls answered. Clearly must be very busy or just too laid back to care. Have never had to chase a sales person, usually it's the other way round..."
- **ANNETTE R** (6 Oct 2025), 0.5 stars, *"Not pleasant"*: "I waited 3 days for photo's of the service books despite my phone calls and messages. When I followed up on day 4, I was told the car was sold by a colleague the previous day. No communication or apologies."
- **Annette R** (21 Oct 2025), 0.5 stars: "Won't deal with them again. Communication bad... was promised a video when back. Didn't respond again despite my attempts. When I followed up again, just got a message they sold it to someone else."
- **Deon U** (23 Dec 2025), 0.5 stars: "Didn't seem very interested in discussing my questions regarding a vehicle I wanted to purchase. I got the impression that I wasted their precious time because prospective buyers should just not ask to many questions. **They also never phoned me back.**"
- **Hendrik B** (26 Aug 2025): "I phoned a couple of times, WhatsApped and emailed them about a bakkie, and they never got back to me."
- **tim j** (19 Nov 2025), 1 star, *"Failed to reply"*: "I asked some basic questions via email. Not answered"
- **Dantre H** (21 Apr 2025), 1 star, *"NOT GOOD!"*: "NEVER CAME BACK TO ME"
- **Rehana V** (15 May 2025), 2 stars: "I never heard back after my enquiry on the app."

**Two patterns emerge:**
1. Leads never get called back (the core problem Intellidial solves).
2. Cars get sold WHILE the buyer is waiting for a response (Annette R x2) — speed literally determines who gets the sale.

### Key insight
Cubbi has a named salesperson mentioned in a bad review: **Brandon** (Seb L's review, 28 Jan 2026). They also have multiple branches (George branch mentioned in one review). This is a **real business with real volume** that is haemorrhaging leads month after month. 15 days since your enquiry with no response confirms it.

---

## Template used
**Template A** — Your own enquiry (15 days, no callback) + the overwhelming pattern. The Seb L quote ("I will not be buying a car from Cubbi now") is the punchline — a buyer literally saying they lost the sale.

**Subject:** my Volvo enquiry — ref CL-153284

Hi Ronald,

I enquired about a Volvo on your AutoTrader listing (ref CL-153284) on 2 February. It's now been over two weeks — no callback.

I checked your AutoTrader reviews and the pattern is clear. One buyer from last month wrote: "I will not be buying a car from Cubbi now." These aren't bad reviews about your cars — they're about leads going unanswered.

I built Intellidial to fix exactly this. It calls your leads back within 60 seconds — day or night. AI qualifies the buyer, confirms interest, and books a viewing into your calendar — you get a notification with the qualified lead. Forward the leads email to us — no system changes.

Would this be worth a quick look?

## Alternate subject lines

| Subject | Notes |
|---------|-------|
| `my Volvo enquiry — ref CL-153284` | **Recommended** — specific, includes ref number (shows it's real) |
| `Volvo enquiry from 2 February — no callback` | More direct, longer timeframe makes it sting more |
| `your AutoTrader leads` | Short, vague curiosity |

## Follow-up schedule

| When | Action |
|------|--------|
| **Day 3** | Bump to Ronald: "Just floating this to the top in case it got buried. Happy to close the loop if it's not relevant." |
| **Day 7** | Send Loom demo link. **CC Preeban Munian** (CEO — preebanm@cubbicars.co.za): "Copying in Preeban in case this lands better at leadership level." |
| **Day 14** | Breakup: "Last note from me. If speed-to-lead isn't a priority now, no worries. If things change, I'm here." |

## Notes
- **15 days since your enquiry** makes this even more powerful than the 6-day ones. Two full weeks, no contact.
- **"These aren't bad reviews about your cars — they're about leads going unanswered"** reframes the problem. You're not saying Cubbi is a bad dealer. You're saying they have a fixable process issue.
- **The Annette R story** (waited 3 days, car sold to someone else) is the perfect illustration of why speed matters. The car didn't go unsold — it went to whoever showed up first. Intellidial makes sure Cubbi's online leads are first in line.
- **Ronald is the right target** — Used Car Sales Manager. His team's performance is directly affected. If he doesn't respond, escalate to the CEO (Preeban) on follow-up #2.
- **Brandon** is named in the Seb L review. Don't name him in the email — it's not about individual blame. Keep it about the system.
