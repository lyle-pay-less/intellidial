## Research summary

### AutoTrader
- **Rating:** 3.4 stars (19 reviews) — 63% five-star, **32% one-star.** Polarised.
- **AutoTrader Customer** (15 Oct 2025), 4 stars: "Only problem is that **many of the vehicles on advert is sold and not removed from the web.**" — Listing hygiene / wasted enquiries; buyers contact about sold cars and get no useful response.
- **Positive:** "Quick turnaround on Whatsapp and problem solvers" (Brent S, 5 stars), "Very communicative and accommodating" (Tim H, 5 stars), "Great and to the point communication" (Andre K, 5 stars).
- **Takeaway:** When response works, it's great. But 32% 1-star + "sold and not removed" = consistency and listing-enquiry gap. Buyers enquire on sold stock or get no callback. Intellidial = call every lead in 60 sec, qualify, confirm availability — so no one wastes time and every real lead gets a call.

### Google
- **Rating:** 5.0 stars (**493 reviews**) — one of the strongest Google profiles in the batch.
- **Specialization:** Independent Land Rover Specialist, "unsurpassed knowledge of Land Rover 4x4s."
- **Takeaway:** Huge gap between Google (5.0, 493) and AutoTrader (3.4, 19). In-person and workshop reputation is excellent; AutoTrader lead follow-up or listing accuracy is the weak link. Same angle as others: compliment expertise and Google reputation, then "your AutoTrader reviews show a gap — we fix that so every lead gets a call within 60 seconds."

## Template used
**Template B + C** — Google vs AutoTrader gap (compliment in-person) + gentle nod to "sold and not removed" and 32% 1-star (consistency / response gap). Position Intellidial as making sure every lead gets a call and no one wastes time on sold stock.

**Subject:** my Land Rover Discovery enquiry on AutoTrader

Hi Louis,

I enquired about your 2018 Land Rover Discovery HSE Luxury TD6 on AutoTrader on 16 February — no callback.

Your Google reputation is outstanding (5.0 stars, 493 reviews) — you're the go-to Land Rover specialist in Stellenbosch. But your AutoTrader reviews tell a different story, with one buyer noting that advertised vehicles are "sold and not removed from the web." That's a response gap, not a service gap.

I built Intellidial to fix exactly that. It calls your leads back within 60 seconds — even at 2am when nobody's at the desk. AI qualifies the buyer, answers questions about the vehicle, and books a viewing into your calendar. You get a notification: qualified warm lead, confirmed time slot.

Happy to show you a 60-second demo — interested?

## Alternate subject lines

| Subject | Notes |
|---------|-------|
| `my Land Rover Discovery enquiry on AutoTrader` | **Recommended** — specific, low-key |
| `Land Rover Discovery TD6 — no callback` | More direct |
| `5.0 on Google, 3.4 on AutoTrader — why the gap?` | Bold — calls out the discrepancy (use if you want to be more provocative). |

## Follow-up schedule

| When | Action |
|------|--------|
| **Day 3** | Bump: "Just floating this to the top in case it got buried. Happy to close the loop if it's not relevant." |
| **Day 7** | Send Loom demo link (90-second walkthrough). |
| **Day 14** | Breakup: "Last note from me. If speed-to-lead isn't a priority now, no worries. If things change, I'm here." |

## Notes
- **Stellenbosch branch** — Use louis@autoexcellence.co.za. Anton is Centurion; don’t use for this listing.
- **Google 5.0 (493) vs AutoTrader 3.4** — Strongest gap in the batch. Compliment their Land Rover expertise and Google reputation first; then "AutoTrader tells a different story" so it doesn’t feel like an attack.
- **"Sold and not removed"** — Use gently. You’re not accusing them of false ads; you’re saying enquiries on sold stock go nowhere and we can fix that (call in 60 sec, confirm availability, say if sold). That protects their reputation and reduces wasted enquiries.
- **40 listings** — Real volume; keeping listings accurate and following up every lead matters. They’re paying for visibility; Intellidial helps them convert it.
- **Slightly longer draft (~145 words)** — The Google vs AutoTrader gap and "sold and not removed" need a sentence each. If you want to trim, drop the "if it's sold we say so straight away" line and keep the rest.
