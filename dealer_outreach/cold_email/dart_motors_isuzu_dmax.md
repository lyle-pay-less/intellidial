## Research summary

### AutoTrader
- **Rating:** **1.6 stars (58 reviews)** — very low; strong pattern of no response.
- **Reviews used for angle:**
  - **Cobus L** (18 Oct 2024), 0.5★: *"No reaction from them"* — "I did not received any call or e-mail or any other communication from them at all. I am still interested in the vehicle. It is just the service is below average."
  - **Ivan M** (24 Oct 2024), 0.5★: *"None responsive"* — "Nobody contacted me."
  - **Bart H** (22 Nov 2024), 0.5★: "Never heard from them. Disappointed. Bought elsewhere from people who wanted my business."
  - **AutoTrader Customer** (3 Dec 2024), 0.5★: "Can't rate what you don't get."
  - **AutoTrader Customer** (4 Dec 2024), 0.5★: "Audi S5" — "Still waiting for them to call me."
  - **Pierre R** (13 Feb 2026), 0.5★: *"No rating as nobody came back to me"* — "Seems like sales people got enough money by NOT following up leads"
  - **Simphiwe N** (31 Oct 2025), 1★: "No response from the Company."
  - **Dion W** (21 Aug 2025), 0.5★: "Nobody contacted me, bought a vehicle elsewhere."
  - **Fareed A** (23 Oct 2025), 0.5★: "No response from them. Left on read."
  - **Lisa B** (24 Oct 2025), 0.5★: "no contact made."
  - **Nazim N** (29 Nov 2025), 0.5★: "No one called mme."
  - **Koenie V** (8 Dec 2025), 0.5★: "No reply received."
  - **Teddy M** (4 Feb 2025), 2★: "they never contacted me."
- **Takeaway:** Overwhelming no-callback / no-response theme. Pierre R (13 Feb 2026) is very recent and directly about "NOT following up leads" — ideal hook. 32 cars, Woodstock; founded 1975, Errol Fall. Strongest fit for IntelliDial in this batch.

### Google
- **Rating:** 3.9 stars (173 reviews). 130 Sir Lowry Rd, Woodstock. Phone 021 465 2675. Opens 8:30 am Mon. No email on listing.
- **Takeaway:** Don't need to reference Google; AutoTrader reviews are the clearest and most damaging — use those.

## Template used
**Template A + B** — "I enquired and you didn't call back" + Pierre R (13 Feb 2026) "Seems like sales people got enough money by NOT following up leads" + Cobus L / Ivan M / Bart H ("no call or e-mail", "Nobody contacted me", "Never heard from them. Bought elsewhere"). Frame IntelliDial as the fix so every lead gets a call — and they stop losing buyers to dealers who do follow up.

## Email draft — SEND THIS ONE

**Subject:** my Isuzu D-Max X-Rider enquiry on AutoTrader

```
Hi Dart Motors team,

I enquired about your 2019 Isuzu D-Max 250 Double Cab X-Rider on AutoTrader on 18 February — no callback.

I saw a recent AutoTrader review (13 Feb): "No rating as nobody came back to me — seems like sales got enough money by NOT following up leads." That's the gap I built IntelliDial to close. We call your leads back within 60 seconds, any hour, any day. AI qualifies the buyer, answers questions about the car, and books a test drive straight into your calendar. You get a notification with a qualified warm lead and a confirmed time slot — no chasing, no missed buyers.

Worth a look for Dart Motors?

## Alternate subject lines

| Subject | Notes |
|---------|-------|
| `my Isuzu D-Max X-Rider enquiry on AutoTrader` | **Recommended** — specific, low-key |
| `Isuzu D-Max 250 enquiry — no callback` | More direct |
| `Nobody came back to me — I built a fix` | Ties to Pierre R; use if you want to be more direct |

## Follow-up schedule

| When | Action |
|------|--------|
| **Day 3** | Bump: "Just floating this to the top in case it got buried. Happy to close the loop if it's not relevant." |
| **Day 7** | Send Loom demo link (90-second walkthrough). Mention: "32 cars on AutoTrader — 58 reviews and a lot of them are about no callback. Every enquiry could get a call in 60 seconds." If no reply to sales@, try **geoff.fall@dartmotors.net** (Director) or **justin.meyer@dartmotors.net** (Manager) if verified, or call 021 465 2675. |
| **Day 14** | Breakup: "Last note from me. If speed-to-lead isn't a priority now, no worries. If things change, I'm here." |

## Notes
- **1.6 stars, 58 reviews** — One of the lowest-rated dealers in the set; "no response" is the dominant theme. Pierre R (13 Feb 2026) is recent and punchy ("NOT following up leads"). Bart H / Dion W "Bought elsewhere" = lost sales; IntelliDial directly addresses that.
- **Geoff Fall (Director), Justin Meyer (Manager)** — Decision-makers; emails above are guessed (dartmotors.net). Verify before relying on them; otherwise sales@ is safe.
- **32 cars, Woodstock, since 1975** — Established dealer; fixing lead follow-up could materially improve reputation and sales.
- **Errol Fall** (founder, AutoTrader blurb) — Same surname as Geoff Fall (Director); possible family business; Director email may be worth verifying for follow-up.
