# Outreach context -- this is not traditional cold email

**Purpose:** Context for anyone (including future you or an AI) working in this folder. The emails here look like "cold outreach" but they work differently. Use this file to understand the style, expectations, and how to prioritise.

---

## 1. What this outreach actually is

**Traditional cold email:** You're a stranger. Subject: "Quick question" or "Partnership idea." They don't know you. Open rate ~40-55%, reply rate ~5-12%.

**This outreach:** You **enquired about a car** on AutoTrader (or similar). The dealer **didn't call you back**. You're now emailing them as **that lead** -- "I enquired about your [car] on [date] -- no callback."

So from the dealer's perspective:
- **Subject / first line:** "My [car] enquiry on AutoTrader" / "I enquired about your [car] on [date] -- no callback."
- **What they think:** "This is a buyer we missed. I need to open this."

You're not a random cold contact. You're **a lead they failed to contact**. Sales/service people are trained to chase missed leads. So:

- **Open rate:** Should be **much higher** than cold -- often **70-85%+**. If they don't open, it's usually "buried in inbox" or "wrong contact," not "sounds like spam."
- **Reply rate:** Also higher -- **15-30%** is realistic. Some reply to "save" the lead; some reply to the product (IntelliDial). Either way you're in a conversation.

**In short:** This is **lead-follow-up framing**, not classic cold. Treat the numbers and send volume accordingly.

## 2. Why it's not bait-and-switch

You *were* a lead (you made a real enquiry). They *did* miss the callback. Then you introduce: "I built a fix for exactly this -- IntelliDial calls your leads back in 60 seconds."

So the sequence is:
1. I was your lead -> you didn't call back.
2. I built the thing that would have prevented that.

That's consistent and relevant. You're not pretending to be a buyer and then switching to "buy my software" with no link. The product directly addresses the problem they just got reminded of (missed lead). A few may feel tricked; most will see the logic. Keep the transition clear and short.

## 3. Realistic expectations for 2-3 pilots

Because open and reply rates are higher than generic cold:

| If you contact... | With follow-ups (Day 3, Day 7) | You can reasonably expect... |
|----------------|--------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| **15-20 dealers** | Yes | 3-5 replies -> 2-4 calls -> **2-3 pilots** plausible |
| **20-25 dealers** | Yes | Comfortable buffer for 2-3 pilots |
| **30+ dealers** | Yes | More than you need unless reply rate is low |

**You do not need to send to every dealer in this folder to get 2-3 pilots.** Start with 15-25 of the best-fit drafts (see below). Add more only if you need more pipeline.

## 4. How to use this folder

### Drafts
- Each `*_*.md` file is **one dealer, one car, one enquiry**. It contains: meta (dealer, car, listing URL, enquiry date), contacts, research (AutoTrader/Google reviews), **SEND THIS ONE** (the email body), subject lines, follow-up schedule, checklist.
- **Contact:** Send to the address in "Send to" (often Dealer Principal or sales contact). Use the greeting and name from the draft.

### Prioritisation (who to send first)
- **Strongest:** Dealers where you have (1) **your own no-callback** and (2) **their public "no response" / "no one got back to me"** (and ideally their apology). Examples from this folder: Autodrome (Kyle N), Autos By US, Autohaven (Kevin W), Auto Monarch (Frances "Nobody answers the phone"), Thorp Bayside, Bargain Auto, William Simpson, Auto Agents CPT, Cubbi, Dart Motors, Exclusive Auto Group, F&S Auto, Fidato, Durbell Autos.
- **Good:** Your no-callback + strong review angle (e.g. "better our service").
- **Weaker:** Your no-callback only, no review to quote (e.g. Autolink, Autospan, Cars 4 Africa, Dream 11 Cars, DS Cars, Faizal Motors, Big Apple Motors). Still valid; use after the strong ones.
- **Skip / verify:** e.g. Autos By US -- Google shows "Permanently closed." Confirm before sending.

### Follow-ups
- **Day 3:** Short bump -- "Just floating this to the top in case it got buried. Happy to close the loop if it's not relevant."
- **Day 7:** Loom (or similar) -- "90-second walkthrough of what happens when a lead comes in." Optional: mention dealer-specific angle (e.g. "21 cars -- every enquiry could get a call in 60 seconds").
- **Day 14:** Breakup -- "Last note from me. If speed-to-lead isn't a priority now, no worries. If things change, I'm here."

### Volume and pacing
- Start with **2-3 sends per day** (warmup is only 6 days old). Scale to 3-5/day in week 2, 5-8/day in week 3+.
- Log: dealer, date sent, subject, template used, reply? (see DEALER_EMAIL_BRAINSTORM.md / tracker).

---

## 5. Tone and rules (from DEALER_EMAIL_BRAINSTORM)

- **Plain text only.** No HTML, images, or logos. One clear CTA (e.g. "Would this be useful for [Dealer]?").
- **No links in the body** of email #1. Website only in signature. Demo link in follow-up #2.
- **Short.** Under ~120 words. Mobile-friendly.
- **Send Tuesday-Thursday, 8-10 AM** where possible.
- **Name:** Use **Lyle** (and intellidial.co.za) in all drafts.

---

## 6. Quick reference

| Term | Meaning |
|------|--------|
| **Enquiry** | The AutoTrader (or similar) form you submitted for a specific car at that dealer. |
| **No callback** | They didn't call you back after that enquiry -- your hook. |
| **Template A** | "I enquired and you didn't call back" (your enquiry only). |
| **Template B** | Your enquiry + their reviews ("no response", "no one got back to me", etc.). |
| **SEND THIS ONE** | The exact email body to use in each dealer's `.md` file. |

---

## 7. Master email structure (v2 -- updated 22 Feb 2026)

Every email should follow this skeleton. The goal of email #1 is **one reply** -- not a close.

```
Line 1:  Hi [Name / Team],
Line 2:  I enquired about your [car] on AutoTrader on [date] -- no callback.
Line 3:  [ONE review-based hook -- Template B only; skip for Template A]
Line 4:  Product pitch (2-3 sentences max -- see below)
Line 5:  Soft CTA
Line 6:  Signature
```

### Product pitch -- use ONE of these rotations (not the same one every time)

**Rotation 1 (default -- "instant call + booking"):**
> I built Intellidial to fix exactly this: when a lead enquires, we call them back within 60 seconds -- day or night, even while your whole team is off. AI qualifies the buyer, answers their questions, and books a viewing straight into your calendar. You get a notification with a qualified, warm lead and a confirmed time slot. You just forward the leads email to us.

**Rotation 2 ("full picture" -- for dealers who value control):**
> I built Intellidial so no lead waits. We call your AutoTrader leads back within 60 seconds -- any hour, any day. AI has a real conversation: qualifies the buyer, answers questions about the car, and books a test drive or viewing into your calendar. You get a notification with the booking, full call transcript, and sentiment breakdown. No app, no system changes -- you just forward the leads email to us.

**Rotation 3 ("short + punchy" -- for template-A-only / clean-rep dealers):**
> I built Intellidial so every lead gets a call -- within 60 seconds, any time of day or night. AI qualifies the buyer, books a viewing into your calendar, and sends you a notification with the full transcript. You just forward the leads email to us.

### CTA -- rotate these (don't use the same one every time)

- "Would a quick walkthrough be worth 2 minutes of your time?"
- "Worth a look for [Dealer]?"
- "Would this be useful for [Dealer]?"
- "Happy to show you a 60-second demo -- interested?"
- "Can I show you what this looks like for one of your leads?"

### "Even at 9pm on a Friday" -- variations

Don't use this line in every email. Rotate:
- "even at 9pm on a Friday"
- "even while your whole team is off"
- "day or night, weekends included"
- "any hour, any day"
- "even at 2am when nobody's at the desk"

### Rules
- **One review quote per email** (pick the strongest). Don't stack 3-4 quotes -- it reads as a wall of text on mobile.
- **Under 120 words** in the body (excluding signature). Shorter = higher reply rate.
- **No links in email #1.** Website only in signature. Demo link in follow-up #2.
- **Plain text.** No HTML, images, logos, or formatting.

## 8. Instantly warmup & deliverability (updated Feb 2026)

### Current status
- **Account:** lyle@intellidial.co.za
- **Warmup started:** 17 Feb 2026
- **Stats:** Check Instantly dashboard for current numbers (e.g. warmup emails received/sent). Update this line when you check.

### Guidance for sending real emails alongside warmup

| Week | Warmup age | Max real emails/day | Notes |
|------|-----------|---------------------|-------|
| **Week 1** (17-23 Feb) | 0-7 days | **2-3** | Keep warmup ON. Send real emails Tue-Thu only. |
| **Week 2** (24 Feb-2 Mar) | 7-14 days | **3-5** | Still conservative. Monitor bounce rate. |
| **Week 3+** (3 Mar+) | 14+ days | **5-8** | Can push higher if 0 bounces and warmup healthy. |

### Rules
- **Keep warmup running** even while sending real emails. Don't disable it.
- **Max 2-3 real emails/day** this week (week 1). You have 35 drafts -- at 3/day that's ~12 days, which is perfect pacing.
- **Send between 8-10 AM SAST, Tue-Thu** for best open rates with SA dealers.
- **Space emails 5-15 minutes apart** (Instantly can do this automatically via campaign settings).
- **Watch for bounces.** If any email bounces, remove that address immediately. More than 2 bounces in a day = pause for 24 hours.
- **Don't send from Instantly AND manually** in the same day. Pick one channel per day.
- **Plain text only.** No tracking pixels, no open tracking, no click tracking in email #1. Turn these OFF in Instantly for the first campaign.
- **Custom tracking domain** -- if you haven't set one up in Instantly, do it now. It prevents your emails from being associated with Instantly's shared domain.
- **SPF, DKIM, DMARC** -- verify these are set up for intellidial.co.za. If any are missing, fix before sending.

### Sending order (priority)
1. **Template A+B "strong" dealers first** -- your no-callback + their "no response" reviews. These have the highest reply probability and a reply signals good sender reputation to Gmail/Outlook.
2. **Template A "good" dealers second** -- your no-callback only. Slightly lower reply rate but still strong.
3. **Template A "weaker" dealers last** -- generic email (info@, sales@) + no review hook.

Early replies + no bounces = good sender reputation = better deliverability for later sends.

---

**Summary:** This folder is **lead-follow-up style outreach**, not classic cold. You contact dealers as a missed lead, then introduce IntelliDial as the fix. Expect high opens and decent replies; **15-25 well-chosen sends with follow-ups** is often enough for 2-3 pilots. Prioritise dealers where you have both your no-callback and their public "no response" reviews. Keep Instantly warmup running; send 2-3 real emails/day in week 1, scaling to 3-5 in week 2 and 5-8 in week 3+.

**Dealer landing page:** Live at **https://intellidial.co.za/dealers**. Use this URL in Day 7 follow-up, Loom CTA, and "see how it works" links — not the homepage.
