## Research summary

### AutoTrader
- **Rating:** 3.2 stars (25 reviewers) — 52% five-star, 40% one-star. Polarised.
- **Reviews used for angle:**
  - **tim j** (15 Sep 2025), 1 star: *"No response to questions, at all"*
  - **George B** (11 Feb 2026), 1 star: *"No reply from dealer"*
  - **AutoTrader Customer** (29 Oct 2024), 4 stars: "They have not contacted me yet or maybe I am just impatient but **they haven't called or emailed me back**". Dealer reply: "Good day. Thank you for your enquiry. Our Jeep specialist is currently on a test drive and will be in touch as soon as he is back in the office. Kind regards, Carmichael Xtreme"
- **Takeaway:** Clear pattern — no response, no reply, haven't called or emailed back. Their own reply ("Jeep specialist on test drive") shows leads wait when one person is busy. Strong fit for IntelliDial: every lead gets a call so nobody waits. 21 cars, Jeep Wrangler specialists.

### Google
- **Rating:** 4.6 stars (44 reviews). Woodstock, Cape Town. "Carmichael buy, sell and hire Jeep Wrangler. Carmichael Xtreme focuses on providing the market with pristine quality pre-owned Jeep Wranglers, SUV's and 4x4's..."
- **Takeaway:** Don't need to reference Google; AutoTrader reviews are the clearest lead-response angle.

## Template used
**Template A + B** — "I enquired and you didn't call back" + tim j "No response to questions, at all" + George B "No reply from dealer" (and optionally AutoTrader Customer "haven't called or emailed me back"). Frame IntelliDial as the fix so every lead gets a call — even when the Jeep specialist is on a test drive.

## Email draft — SEND THIS ONE

**Subject:** my Jeep Wrangler Sahara enquiry on AutoTrader

```
Hi Carmichael Xtreme team,

I enquired about your 2014 Jeep Wrangler 3.6L Sahara on AutoTrader on 18 February — no callback.

One of your AutoTrader reviews says: "No reply from dealer." Your team replied that the Jeep specialist was on a test drive — that's exactly the gap I built IntelliDial to close. It calls your leads back within 60 seconds, any hour, any day. AI qualifies the buyer, answers questions about the Wrangler, and books a viewing into your calendar. You get a notification with the qualified warm lead and confirmed time slot — even when your specialist is out. Just forward the leads email to us.

Would a quick walkthrough be worth 2 minutes of your time?

| When | Action |
|------|--------|
| **Day 3** | Bump: "Just floating this to the top in case it got buried. Happy to close the loop if it's not relevant." |
| **Day 7** | Send Loom demo link (90-second walkthrough). Mention: "21 cars on AutoTrader — every Jeep enquiry could get a call in 60 seconds, even when your specialist is on a test drive." If no reply, try Kyle Tait or Jack Stark via WhatsApp (from dealer profile). |
| **Day 14** | Breakup: "Last note from me. If speed-to-lead isn't a priority now, no worries. If things change, I'm here." |

## Notes
- **tim j + George B + AutoTrader Customer** — "No response to questions, at all", "No reply from dealer", "haven't called or emailed me back" are direct lead-follow-up complaints. Their reply ("Jeep specialist on test drive") gives you a constructive angle: you're not attacking — you're offering the fix for when one person is busy.
- **21 cars, Jeep Wrangler specialists** — Woodstock. Every lead matters; IntelliDial = lead gets a call even when specialist is unavailable.
- **Kyle Tait, Jack Stark** — Sales reps on dealer profile (WhatsApp); use for follow-up if info@ doesn't reply.
- **Woodstock** — Cape Town, same dealer pool as your other emails.
