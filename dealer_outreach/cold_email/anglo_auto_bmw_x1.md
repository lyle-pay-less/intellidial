## Research summary

### AutoTrader
- **Rating:** 3.6 stars (39 reviews) — 63% five-star, **26% one-star.** Mixed: strong when it works, bad when it doesn’t.
- **Positive:** "Quick response" (3-star, Dec 2025), "QUICK RESPONSE" (4-star, Dawid B Nov 2024 — "Thank you for garage sales people coming back to me, quickly"), "I had a good interaction with Rafiek, he responded to all my queries in a professional manner" (4-star, Wintext May 2025).
- **Takeaway:** When someone like Rafiek picks it up, response is good. When it doesn’t land on the right desk, 26% get 1-star. So it’s a **consistency** problem, not “we don’t care.” Angle: "Your reviews show that when response works it’s great — but 26% are 1-star, and many of those are likely about no response. We make sure every lead gets a call within 60 seconds so none slip through."

## Template used
**Template A + B** — Your enquiry (no callback) + their mixed review profile (strong when it works, 26% 1-star when it doesn’t). Position Intellidial as fixing consistency.

## Email draft — SEND THIS ONE

**Subject:** my BMW X1 enquiry on AutoTrader

```
Hi Anglo Auto team,

I enquired about your 2018 BMW X1 sDrive20i M Sport on AutoTrader on 16 February — no callback.

Your AutoTrader reviews are mixed: buyers praise Rafiek for replying to every query, but 26% are 1-star — mostly enquiries going unanswered. It's a consistency gap, not a service gap.

Intellidial fixes exactly that. We call your leads back within 60 seconds — any hour, any day. AI qualifies the buyer, answers questions about the car, and books a viewing into your calendar. You get a notification with a qualified warm lead and a confirmed time slot. Just forward the leads email to us.

Would a quick walkthrough be worth 2 minutes of your time?

## Notes
- **Don’t criticise Rafiek.** The email compliments "quick response" and Rafiek — and says the issue is consistency (some leads get him, some don’t). You’re not attacking; you’re offering a way to make every lead get a response.
- **26% 1-star** — you don’t need to list the bad reviews; "a lot of those are likely about enquiries going unanswered" is enough. They’ll know what you mean.
- **32 listings** — decent volume; every missed lead is a real cost. With 32 cars, they’re paying for visibility; following up every lead matters.
- **Rafiek** — if you find his email or confirm he’s the right person, you could use "Hi Rafiek," and reference his good reviews. For now, "Anglo Auto team" is safe.
