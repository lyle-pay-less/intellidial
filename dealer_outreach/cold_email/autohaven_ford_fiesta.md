## Research summary

### AutoTrader
- **Rating:** 2.5 stars (13 reviewers) — 69% one-star, 31% five-star. Polarised.
- **Reviews used for angle:**
  - **Kevin W** (10 Feb 2025), 0.5 stars: *"No call back."*
  - **AutoTrader Customer** (08 Aug 2025), 1 star: *"No response"* — "Got no response from the dealer".
- **Takeaway:** Clear pattern: no callback, no response. Strong fit for IntelliDial — every lead gets a call so the next Kevin doesn't leave a 0.5-star review.

### Google
- **Rating:** 4.5 stars (43 reviews).
- **AB** (7 years ago), 1 star: "Dishonest. Make sure to do proper homework on any vehicle before considering buying from..." — post-sale / trust issue, not lead follow-up.
- **Takeaway:** Don't reference Google in this email — keep angle to lead response only (AutoTrader "No call back" / "No response").

---

## Template used
**Template A + B** — "I enquired and you didn't call back" + Kevin W "No call back" + AutoTrader Customer "Got no response from the dealer". Frame IntelliDial as the fix so every lead gets a call.

## Email draft — SEND THIS ONE

**Subject:** my Ford Fiesta enquiry on AutoTrader

```
Hi Autohaven team,

I enquired about your 2017 Ford Fiesta 5-Door 1.5TDCi on AutoTrader on 18 February — no callback.

One of your AutoTrader reviews reads: "No call back." With 30 cars listed, every missed lead is a missed sale — and a review like that. I built IntelliDial to fix this: it calls your leads back within 60 seconds, even while your whole team is off. AI qualifies the buyer, answers questions about the car, and books a viewing straight into your calendar. You get a notification with the qualified lead and confirmed time slot. Just forward the leads email to us.

Can I show you what this looks like for one of your leads?

## Alternate subject lines

| Subject | Notes |
|---------|-------|
| `my Ford Fiesta enquiry on AutoTrader` | **Recommended** — specific, low-key |
| `Ford Fiesta 1.5TDCi enquiry — no callback` | More direct |
| `No call back — I built a fix for lead follow-up` | Ties to Kevin W; use if you want to be more direct |

## Follow-up schedule

| When | Action |
|------|--------|
| **Day 3** | Bump: "Just floating this to the top in case it got buried. Happy to close the loop if it's not relevant." |
| **Day 7** | Send Loom demo link (90-second walkthrough). Mention: "30 cars on AutoTrader — every enquiry could get a call in 60 seconds." If no reply from first contact, try Siebert or Francois directly. |
| **Day 14** | Breakup: "Last note from me. If speed-to-lead isn't a priority now, no worries. If things change, I'm here." |

## Notes
- **Kevin W + AutoTrader Customer** — "No call back" and "Got no response from the dealer" are direct lead-follow-up complaints. No need to name reviewers; the pattern speaks for itself.
- **30 cars, 35 years** — family business, established. Every lead matters; 69% 1-star on AutoTrader is mostly about response. Keep tone constructive: you're offering the fix, not attacking.
- **Hermanus** — Western Cape; same region as your other dealer emails. Slightly further out (Hermanus Industria) but same Cape dealer pool for IntelliDial.
