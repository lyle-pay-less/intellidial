## Research summary

### AutoTrader
- **Rating:** **2.8 stars (25 reviews)** — 48% one-star in visible sample.
- **Reviews used for angle:**
  - **AutoTrader Customer** (7 Jan 2025), 1★: *"I've sent multiple emails regarding a few cars. I haven't gotten any feedback as till now."*
  - **Dealer reply** (11 Mar 2025): "we scoured our emails looking for an enquiry from you to no avail. Your review is likely spam."
  - **Deston L** (3 Oct 2025), 1★: *"the dealer did not reply to my enquiry".*
- **Other reviews:** AutoTrader Customer (18 Feb 2026) 4.5★ "Top-notch personalised service" — "old-school service from a true family business"; Amie S (17 Apr 2025) 5★ "Great."
- **Takeaway:** "Multiple emails... no feedback" and "dealer did not reply to my enquiry" are direct lead-follow-up complaints. Their reply ("scoured our emails... to no avail") shows enquiries get lost in the inbox — IntelliDial = every lead gets a call in 60 seconds so no lost emails. 14 cars, Silverhurst, father-son, online/by appointment. Strong fit for IntelliDial.

### Google
- **Rating:** 4.7 stars (28 reviews). Fidato - Premium & Exotic Cars. 14 Pear Ln, Constantia, Cape Town 7806. Phone 065 709 1777, fidato.co.za. Opens 9 am Mon.
- **Takeaway:** Don't reference Google; AutoTrader reviews are the clearest angle (lost enquiries / no reply).

### Facebook
- Fidato: "At Fidato we specialise in the Procurement, Sales & Buying of premium vehicles." "Strictly online business, viewings by appointment only." Constantia, Cape Town. **Fidato.cpt@gmail.com**, 065 709 1777. Autotrader: autotrader.co.za/dealer/fidato/31105.
- **Takeaway:** Gmail is primary contact; online + appointment-only = every missed enquiry is a missed appointment.

## Template used
**Template A + B** — "I enquired and you didn't call back" + AutoTrader Customer ("I've sent multiple emails regarding a few cars. I haven't gotten any feedback as till now") + Deston L ("the dealer did not reply to my enquiry"). Their reply ("scoured our emails... to no avail") = enquiries get lost — frame IntelliDial as the fix so every lead gets a call and nothing slips through the inbox.

## Email draft — SEND THIS ONE

**Subject:** my VW Polo 1.0TSI Comfortline enquiry on AutoTrader

```
Hi Fidato team,

I enquired about your 2018 VW Polo 1.0TSI Comfortline on AutoTrader on 19 February — no callback.

I noticed an AutoTrader review: one buyer said they'd "sent multiple emails" and "haven't gotten any feedback." Your reply was that you'd scoured your emails and found nothing — enquiries getting lost is exactly what I built IntelliDial to fix. We call your leads back within 60 seconds, day or night, weekends included. AI qualifies the buyer, answers questions about the car, and books a viewing straight into your calendar. You get a notification with a qualified warm lead and a confirmed time slot — no more lost enquiries.

Can I show you what this looks like for one of your leads?
