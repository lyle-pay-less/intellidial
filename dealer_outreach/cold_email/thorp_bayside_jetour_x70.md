### About Thorp Motor Group
- **Multi-branch group** — Plumstead, Table View, N1 City, Table Bay Mall, Bayside, Brackenfell.
- **Brands:** Suzuki, GWM, Haval, Jetour, MG, Chery, OMODA, Lepas, JAECOO, Geely.
- **56 active listings** on AutoTrader (Bayside branch).
- This is a **professional, established group** — not a small independent. That means: more leads, more process, more people involved in the decision. Also means the problem is bigger (more leads falling through the cracks across branches).

- **Sello M** (12 Feb 2026), 1 star, *"Bad customer service"*: **"No one contacted me."** — This was posted THE DAY AFTER your enquiry. Could even be about YOUR enquiry.

### Google (Thorp Motor Group - Bayside)
- **Rating:** 4.0 stars (9 reviews).

- **Leopold** (1 star, ~8 months ago): "Terrible customer service!"
- **Takeaway:** Google reviews reinforce the service issue, but the AutoTrader ones are more specific to the lead follow-up problem.

## Template used
**Template B** — reviews clearly show no-contact pattern + your own enquiry confirms it. Strong because the Sello M review is from 12 Feb (day after your enquiry).

## Email draft — SEND THIS ONE

**Subject:** my Jetour X70 Plus enquiry on AutoTrader

```
Hi Jacques,

I enquired about your Jetour X70 Plus 1.5T on AutoTrader on 11 February — no callback.

The day after my enquiry, someone left a 1-star review on your AutoTrader page: "No one contacted me." With 56 listings, that's a lot of leads to keep up with.

I built Intellidial to fix exactly this. It calls your leads back within 60 seconds — even at 9pm on a Friday. AI qualifies the buyer, answers questions about the car, and books a test drive into your calendar. You get a notification with the qualified lead and confirmed time slot.

Forward the leads email to us — no system changes.

Can I show you what this looks like for one of your leads?

| Subject | Notes |
|---------|-------|
| `my Jetour X70 Plus enquiry on AutoTrader` | **Recommended** — specific, low-key |
| `Jetour X70 Plus enquiry — no callback` | More direct |
| `56 listings, how many callbacks?` | Bold — could work for a larger group that gets volume |

## Follow-up schedule

| When | Action |
|------|--------|
| **Day 3** | Bump: "Just floating this to the top in case it got buried. Happy to close the loop if it's not relevant." |
| **Day 7** | Send Loom demo link. Mention multi-branch angle: "This could work across all your Thorp branches, not just Bayside." |
| **Day 14** | Breakup: "Last note from me. If speed-to-lead isn't a priority now, no worries. If things change, I'm here." |

## Notes
- **Thorp is a group with 6 branches.** If you land this, the upsell is huge — Intellidial across all branches. Mention this in follow-up #2, not email #1.
- **The Sello M review (12 Feb) is incredibly powerful.** It was posted the day after your own enquiry. You can say "the day after my enquiry" without even naming the reviewer — the timing speaks for itself.
- **Don't reference the Google reviews** (too vague — "terrible customer service" / "treat customer as inconvenience"). Stick to the specific AutoTrader "no one contacted me" angle.
