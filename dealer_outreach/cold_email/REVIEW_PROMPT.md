# Review Prompt — Cold Email Campaign (22 Feb 2026)

This is the prompt I used to get the full review and update of all 35 email drafts.

---

I finally finished all my cold email drafts based on the 100 enquiries I done. These are the ones that didnt really get back to me.

The Research I done was:
- make an enquiry
- check who didnt reply
- check their reviews on autotrader
- check the comments of the reviews on autotrader
- check how many cars they selling/in stock
- check there review on google
- check the comments on google
- check facebook, their website, apollo, use gemini, to find the email address of a contact, preferably owner / dealer principle or sales manager, else I just have to use generic email I find info@ sales@ etc

Then use all this info to come up with a hyper personlized email, that looks like I done it by hand. This email has to show:
- I done an enquiry
- I done research on their company
- what my product can do

Which is instantly call their next lead after they made an enquiry and book a viewing for them in calendly and they will get a notification, that they have a new lead, qualified and warm ready to view or test drive with a booking time.

The instant service is really great because it can happen at anytime of day, night or day of the week, even while the entire company is sleeping. This is the new age.

The product has full transcript and sentiment analysis and the AI understands it fully.

Also keep in mind my instantly mail warmup has been running for a week (6 days).

My campaign will be 3 to 5 emails a day, obviously I dont want to end up in spam as well.

Please to the best of your ability review my emails and make any updates needed to make sure this is a success and I get replies.

Remember this is also not really a cold email in a sense — I made real enquiries and I didnt get a response. I have a real solution to solve this. The communication is pivotal to get the response. You are the renowned marketing lead research analyst, do your thing!
