## Research summary

### AutoTrader
- **Rating:** 4.4 stars (29 reviewers) — 94% five-star, but clear contact issues.
- **Reviews used for angle:**
  - **Philisiwe R** (8 Oct 2025), 2 stars: *"No one contacted me!"* — "I enquired about a car and never received a call or email." Dealer replied they eventually got hold of client after multiple attempts.
  - **Shane b** (9 Jul 2025), 1 star: *"I was never contacted up until today."* Dealer response: "We have been in contact with Auto Trader as there is a problem between their system and ours. Auto Trader is busy working on the problem."
- **Takeaway:** Dealer is aware of follow-up/system issues and has blamed AutoTrader integration. Strong fit for “we fix exactly this.”

### Google
- **Rating:** 4.2 stars (184 reviews).
- **Review used for angle:**
  - **Claude Erasmus** (1 star, ~1 year ago): Contacted salesman from the ad; salesman said he’d get back when he got to work, never did. Next evening contacted again — vehicle already sold. *"Very unreliable from the salesman. I was ready to buy the vehicle."*
- **Other:** “Add website” suggested on listing — may not have a website; 086 128 8634.

**Subject:** my Haval H6 GT enquiry on AutoTrader

```
Hi Jan,

I enquired about your Haval H6 GT Luxury on AutoTrader on 11 February — no callback.

I also noticed a couple of your AutoTrader reviews mention enquiries going unanswered, and your team's reply about system issues between AutoTrader and your side. That's exactly what I built a fix for.

Intellidial calls your leads back within 60 seconds — day or night, weekends included. AI qualifies the buyer, answers questions about the car, and books a test drive straight into your calendar. You get a notification with a qualified warm lead and a confirmed time slot. Just forward the leads email to us; no integration with AutoTrader needed.

Worth a look for Bargain Auto?
