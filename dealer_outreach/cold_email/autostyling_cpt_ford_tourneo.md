## Research summary

### AutoTrader
- **Rating:** 2.5 stars (29 reviews) — **60% one-star.** This is the worst-rated dealer in the batch.
- **heni e** (27 Oct 2025), 1.5 stars: "Attempted to contact Dealer about this Vehicle by message and calling on the Listed phone number (x 2). No response at all, so what should I do next .?"
- **AutoTrader Customer** (30 Oct 2024), 0.5 stars, *"Shocking"*: **"Enquired 3 times, not one response."**
- **Takeaway:** Multiple buyers, multiple attempts, zero response. This isn't a one-off — it's a systemic problem. 60% one-star reviews is brutal. This dealer desperately needs help but may also be the hardest to convert (if they don't care about reviews, they might not care about leads either).

### Google (Autostyling Cape Town)
- **Rating:** 4.1 stars (58 reviews) — significantly better than AutoTrader, which suggests the in-person experience is OK but online lead handling is broken.
- **Riaz Raju (Rio)** (1 star, ~4 years ago): "Dont have a clue as to what they are doing. Need to come to JHB for some free lessons."
- **Paul Auret** (1 star, ~2 years ago): "Worst customer service ever."
- **Takeaway:** Google reviews are older and less specific. The AutoTrader reviews are far more damning and recent. Stick to AutoTrader angle.

### Key insight
The gap between Google (4.1) and AutoTrader (2.5) tells the story: **buyers who walk in have an OK experience, but online enquiries get ignored.** That's the exact problem Intellidial solves.

## Template used
**Template B** — Reviews show extreme non-contact pattern. The "Enquired 3 times, not one response" quote is devastating but use it gently.

## Email draft — SEND THIS ONE

**Subject:** my Ford Tourneo enquiry on AutoTrader

```
Hi Autostyling CPT team,

I enquired about your Ford Tourneo Custom on AutoTrader on 11 February — no callback.

I noticed your AutoTrader reviews — one buyer wrote "Enquired 3 times, not one response." Your Google reviews are much stronger (4.1 stars), so the in-person experience is clearly solid. Online leads are the gap.

Intellidial fixes exactly this. It calls your leads back within 60 seconds — any hour, any day. AI qualifies the buyer, answers questions about the car, and books a viewing into your calendar. You get a notification: qualified warm lead, confirmed time slot. Just forward the leads email to us.

Can I show you what this looks like for one of your leads?

## Alternate subject lines

| Subject | Notes |
|---------|-------|
| `my Ford Tourneo enquiry on AutoTrader` | **Recommended** — specific, low-key |
| `Ford Tourneo Custom enquiry — no callback` | More direct |
| `4.1 on Google, 2.5 on AutoTrader — why the gap?` | Bold — calls out the discrepancy directly. High risk, high reward. |

## Follow-up schedule

| When | Action |
|------|--------|
| **Day 3** | Bump: "Just floating this to the top in case it got buried. Happy to close the loop if it's not relevant." |
| **Day 7** | Send Loom demo link (90-second walkthrough). |
| **Day 14** | Breakup: "Last note from me. If speed-to-lead isn't a priority now, no worries. If things change, I'm here." |

## Notes
- **The Google vs AutoTrader gap is the smartest angle here.** Instead of just saying "your reviews are bad," you're complimenting their in-person service (4.1 Google) and framing the AutoTrader problem as a separate, fixable issue. This is constructive, not confrontational.
- **60% one-star on AutoTrader is alarming.** Be careful — this dealer might genuinely not care, or they might be too overwhelmed/small to handle online leads. Either way, the email is worth sending.
- **"Enquired 3 times, not one response"** is referenced indirectly ("a few buyers mention enquiring multiple times") rather than quoting it directly. Less aggressive.
- **22 listings = real ad spend.** They're paying to be on AutoTrader. That makes the wasted-leads argument even stronger — "you're paying for leads you're not following up on."
