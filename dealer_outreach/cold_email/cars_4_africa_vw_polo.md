## Research summary

### AutoTrader
- **Rating:** 4.3 stars (19 reviewers) — 90% five-star, 5% four-star, 5% one-star.
- **Reviews:** Lebeko S (15 Jul 2025), 5★: *"They responded promptly to my queries and also followed up on my requests to them."* Hein L (18 Jul 2025), 5★: "Fast and freindly service." Thamisanqa Hlophe H (19 Jun 2025), 5★: "Great." One 1-star (5% = 1 reviewer) but **content not visible** — no usable "no response" quote.
- **Takeaway:** Strong reputation; prompt response is a stated strength. **No Template B** — don't invent or overstate the 1-star. Use **Template A only**: your no-callback + "even when you're on the ball, leads can slip through when someone's busy or it's after hours" + IntelliDial as backup so every lead gets a call. 29 cars, 20+ years experience.

## Template used
**Template A only** — "I enquired and you didn't call back." No quote from their reviews (no clear "no response" snippet). Angle: your missed callback + "even the best dealers miss leads when someone's busy or it's after hours" + IntelliDial calls every lead back in 60 seconds so nobody slips through.

## Email draft — SEND THIS ONE

**Subject:** my VW Polo Comfortline enquiry on AutoTrader

```
Hi Schelton,

I enquired about your 2020 VW Polo 1.0TSI Comfortline on AutoTrader on 18 February — no callback.

I see Cars 4 Africa has a solid rep — one reviewer said you "responded promptly" and "followed up." Even so, leads slip through when someone's busy or it's after hours. I built IntelliDial so every lead gets a call: it calls your AutoTrader leads back within 60 seconds, even at 2am when nobody's at the desk. AI qualifies the buyer, answers questions about the car, and books a viewing into your calendar. You get a notification with the qualified warm lead and confirmed time slot. Just forward the leads email to us.

Happy to show you a 60-second demo — interested?

## Notes
- **Schelton Daniels, Owner** — Decision-maker; verified email. Use "Hi Schelton" for personalisation without overdoing it.
- **No "no response" hook** — AutoTrader reviews are mostly positive (90% 5★). One 1-star exists but text not visible; don't fabricate. Template A (your no-callback + "even the best miss leads when busy") is the right angle.
- **29 cars, 20+ years** — Table View. IntelliDial = backup so every enquiry gets a call when the team is busy or after hours.
- **sales@ + WhatsApp** — Use for follow-up if schelton@ doesn't reply.
