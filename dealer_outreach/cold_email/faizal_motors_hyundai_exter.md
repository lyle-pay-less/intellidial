## Template used
**Template A only** — "I enquired and you didn't call back." No quote from their reviews (visible ones are positive; no "no response" snippet). Angle: your missed callback + "even with transparency and great reviews when it works, leads slip through when someone's busy or after hours" + IntelliDial calls every lead back in 60 seconds so nobody slips through.

**Subject:** my Hyundai Exter Executive enquiry on AutoTrader

Hi Faizal Motors team,

I enquired about your 2025 Hyundai Exter 1.2 Executive Manual on AutoTrader on 19 February — no callback.

I see Faizal Motors has a solid rep — your reviews mention "quick and easy," "very reliable," and "complete transparency." Even so, leads slip through when someone's busy or it's after hours. I built IntelliDial to catch those: we call your leads back within 60 seconds, even while your whole team is off. AI qualifies the buyer, answers questions about the car, and books a viewing straight into your calendar. You get a notification with a qualified warm lead and a confirmed time slot — no lead left waiting.

Would a quick walkthrough be worth 2 minutes of your time?
