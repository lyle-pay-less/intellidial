## Research summary

### AutoTrader
- **Rating:** 4.6 stars (56 reviews) — 89% five-star, only 4% one-star. **This is a well-reviewed dealer.**
- No obvious "no one contacted me" reviews on AutoTrader.
- **Takeaway:** Strong AutoTrader profile. Template C (good-rated dealer, create urgency) is the right approach. Can't use the bad-review angle here.

### Google (MyRide Malmesbury Pre-Owned)
- **Rating:** 4.7 stars (63 reviews) — excellent.
- **Petrus Oosthuizen** (5 stars, ~2 months ago): "I have never had such a great experience, purchasing a vehicle. The whole transaction was done within 4 days since I phoned the first time. Everything was done electronically." — Owner replied warmly.
- **Julisna De Wit Johan** (1 star, ~2 years ago): **"Never phoned me back?"** — Owner replied: "Apologies, we don't have your names in our lead register. Can you perhaps remember who you spoke to at our Malmesbury branch? Alternatively, kindly send us your contact number or contact Christo on 0833048444."
- **Esma Du Preez** (1 star, ~2 years ago) — Owner replied: "We don't have your name in our customer data base. You are welcome to liaise directly with us at sales31@myride.co.za."
- **Takeaway:** The owner actively responds to reviews. When leads slip through, they blame missing data in their lead register. This is a **professional, engaged dealer** that has a process gap — leads aren't making it into their system. Perfect fit for Intellidial's email-forwarding approach.

### Key insight
This dealer is GOOD. They care about service, they reply to every review, they have a real process. But leads are still falling through — their own review replies prove it ("we don't have your names in our lead register"). The angle isn't "you're bad" — it's "you're great, but your system has a gap, and I can close it."

## Template used
**Template C** — Good-rated dealer + acknowledgement of their quality + address the lead register gap from their own review replies.

## Email draft — SEND THIS ONE

**Subject:** my Fortuner enquiry on AutoTrader

Hi MyRide Malmesbury team,

I enquired about your Toyota Fortuner 2.4GD-6 on AutoTrader on 11 February — no callback.

Your ratings are excellent (4.6 on AutoTrader, 4.7 on Google) — clearly a tight operation. But I noticed a Google review reply where your team mentioned not having the customer's name in the lead register. That's a system gap, not a service gap.

I built Intellidial to close exactly that. It calls your leads back within 60 seconds — day or night, weekends included. AI qualifies the buyer, answers questions about the car, and books a viewing into your calendar. You get a notification: qualified warm lead, confirmed time slot. No leads fall through.

Would a quick walkthrough be worth 2 minutes of your time?

## Follow-up schedule

| When | Action |
|------|--------|
| **Day 3** | Bump: "Just floating this to the top in case it got buried. Happy to close the loop if it's not relevant." |
| **Day 7** | Send Loom demo link. Mention multi-branch angle: "This could cover Bellville, Malmesbury, and Paarl — one setup." |
| **Day 14** | Breakup: "Last note from me. If speed-to-lead isn't a priority now, no worries. If things change, I'm here." If no reply, try Christo directly (083 304 8444 — named in review replies as escalation contact). |

## Notes
- **This is a HIGH-VALUE target.** 3 branches, professional operation, engaged owner who replies to reviews. If you land MyRide, it could scale to all 3 branches.
- **Tone is respectful and complimentary.** Don't treat this like the 2.5-star dealers. They're good — acknowledge it. The angle is "system gap, not service gap."
- **"We don't have your names in our lead register"** is their own admission from Google review replies. Using this phrase shows you did deep research and understood the exact problem.
- **Christo** is a senior person (named in review replies for customer escalation). If sales53@ doesn't respond, try calling Christo directly on follow-up day 14.
- **"Would this be useful across your MyRide branches?"** plants the multi-branch seed without overselling it.
