## Research summary

### AutoTrader
- **Rating:** 3.6 stars (6 reviews) — 66% five-star but 17% one-star.
- **JP v** (16 Apr 2025), 0.5 stars, *"Bad"*: "No one interven or called." Dealer response same day: **"no call or email received from van der merwe"** — the dealer literally denied ever getting the lead, pushing blame back on the customer.
- **Takeaway:** The dealer's OWN response is the angle. They're saying they never received the lead. That's either an AutoTrader delivery issue or leads are falling through the cracks on their side. Either way — Intellidial fixes it by bypassing the problem entirely (email forwarding, not platform integration).

### Google
- **Rating:** 4.3 stars (36 reviews). Facebook: 5/5 (4 votes).
- **Grant Ross** (1 star, ~1 year ago): "They sell great cars, but the after sales service was poor... he advised he will sort it out and get back to me... he never ever got back to me after he said he would."
- **Wade Talliard** (1 star, ~2 years ago): "Very poor service from Weslyn de Bruyn. He trades as a representative from V5 auto trader..." — mentions specific salesperson name, but this is about a different trade name (V5), possibly operating from same premises.
- **Takeaway:** Google reviews show a "never got back to me" pattern. Don't reference Wade's review (different business name). Grant Ross's review reinforces the follow-up theme.

## Template used
**Template A + B hybrid** — "I enquired and didn't get a callback" + their own review response where they denied receiving the lead.

## Email draft — SEND THIS ONE

**Subject:** my Polo GTI enquiry on AutoTrader

```
Hi Lester,

I enquired about your VW Polo GTI on AutoTrader on 11 February — no callback.

I noticed on your AutoTrader reviews that when a buyer had the same experience, your team replied that no lead was received on your side. Whether it's an AutoTrader delivery issue or leads slipping through, I built something that eliminates the problem entirely.

Intellidial calls your leads back within 60 seconds — even while your whole team is off. AI qualifies the buyer, answers questions about the car, and books a viewing straight into your calendar. You get a full call transcript. Forward the leads email to us — bypasses AutoTrader entirely.

Can I show you what this looks like for one of your leads?

## Alternate subject lines

| Subject | Notes |
|---------|-------|
| `my Polo GTI enquiry on AutoTrader` | **Recommended** — specific, low-key |
| `VW Polo GTI enquiry — no callback` | More direct |
| `AutoTrader leads not coming through?` | Empathetic — speaks to their stated problem (they claim they never received the lead) |

---

## Follow-up schedule

| When | Action |
|------|--------|
| **Day 3** | Bump: "Just floating this to the top in case it got buried. Happy to close the loop if it's not relevant." |
| **Day 7** | Send Loom demo link (90-second walkthrough). |
| **Day 14** | Breakup: "Last note from me. If speed-to-lead isn't a priority now, no worries. If things change, I'm here." |

## Notes
- **The dealer's own review response is your best angle.** They said they never received the lead — you're not accusing them, you're offering a fix for exactly that problem. "Whether it's an AutoTrader delivery issue or leads slipping through" is diplomatic.
- **Small independent dealer** — cell phone number (079), not a landline. Likely owner-operated. Decision maker is probably whoever reads this email.
- **Don't reference Google reviews** — Grant Ross is about after-sales, not lead follow-up. Wade Talliard mentions a different business name (V5). Keep it to the AutoTrader angle only.
- **"No reliance on AutoTrader's system at all"** is the key differentiator for this dealer — they've already blamed AutoTrader's system. Show them a way around it.
