## Research summary

### AutoTrader
- **Rating:** 3.8 stars (14 reviewers) — 65% five-star, 14% one-star, 14% three-star, 7% four-star.
- **Reviews used for angle:**
  - **Peter j** (06 Feb 2025), 3 stars: *"no response"* — Dealer reply: "Your message came through at 10:13 and the next morning at 08:13 the sales team send you a response. You how ever still requested if the vehicle came with roadworthy."
  - **Niel C** (30 Dec 2024), 1 star: *"Not helpfull from the saleman"* — "No support from salesman". Dealer (Johan): Apology in Afrikaans for "negligence on our part."
  - **AutoTrader Customer** (26 Mar 2025), 2.5 stars: *"No communication to let me know if i qualify or anything"* — "No one got back to me". Dealer: "I'm very sorry that no one got back to you when you requested information about the vehicle."
  - **AutoTrader Customer** (28 Mar 2025), 1 star: "Struggling to get feedback from sales exec and manager -vehicle mileage incorrect." Dealer: Apology for difficulty reaching sales team and incorrect mileage info.
- **Takeaway:** Clear pattern — no response, no one got back, struggling to get feedback. Dealer has publicly apologised. Strong fit for IntelliDial: every lead gets a call so "no one got back to me" doesn't happen again.

### Google

## Template used
**Template A + B** — "I enquired and you didn't call back" + their AutoTrader reviews ("no response", "No one got back to me", "Struggling to get feedback from sales exec") and their own apologies. Frame IntelliDial as the fix so every lead gets a call.

## Email draft — SEND THIS ONE

**Subject:** my Kia Rio enquiry on AutoTrader

```
Hi Autos By US team,

I enquired about your 2014 Kia Rio hatch 1.4 Tec on AutoTrader on 18 February — no callback.

One of your AutoTrader reviews says: "No one got back to me." Your team replied apologising — that's exactly the gap I built IntelliDial to close. It calls your leads back within 60 seconds, any hour, any day. AI qualifies the buyer, answers questions about the car, and books a viewing into your calendar. You get a notification with the qualified lead and confirmed time slot. Just forward the leads email to us — no more "no one got back to me."

Would a quick walkthrough be worth 2 minutes of your time?

## Alternate subject lines

| Subject | Notes |
|---------|-------|
| `my Kia Rio enquiry on AutoTrader` | **Recommended** — specific, low-key |
| `Kia Rio 1.4 Tec enquiry — no callback` | More direct |
| `No one got back to me — I built a fix` | Ties to their review; use if you want to be more direct |

## Follow-up schedule

| When | Action |
|------|--------|
| **Day 3** | Bump: "Just floating this to the top in case it got buried. Happy to close the loop if it's not relevant." |
| **Day 7** | Send Loom demo link (90-second walkthrough). Mention: "15 cars on AutoTrader — every enquiry could get a call in 60 seconds." |
| **Day 14** | Breakup: "Last note from me. If speed-to-lead isn't a priority now, no worries. If things change, I'm here." |

## Notes
- **Permanently closed (Google)** — Confirm whether Autos By US is still trading before sending. If closed, remove from send list.
- **Peter j + AutoTrader Customer** — "no response", "No one got back to me", "Struggling to get feedback" are direct lead-follow-up complaints. Dealer (Johan) has apologised for "negligence" — you're offering the fix they've already said they're sorry about.
- **15 cars** on AutoTrader — Goodwood Central; every lead matters. "Including roadworthy" in the email nods to Peter j's question without naming him.
