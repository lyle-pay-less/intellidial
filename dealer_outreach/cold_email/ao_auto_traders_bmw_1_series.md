## Research summary

### AutoTrader
- **Rating:** 3.4 stars from **1 reviewer only** — very limited data.
- **Single review:** **Shaun S** (23 Sep 2025), 4.5 stars, *"Great service"*: "Awesome service, **very responsive** and honest dealership!" Dealer replied: "Thank you, Shaun you have been such a pleasure to deal with. We really appreciate your Business. Happy Motoring from The AO Auto Trader Team."
- **Takeaway:** Their only review says they're "very responsive" — but you got no callback in 24 hours. That's either one lead that slipped through or a gap when they're busy. Don't attack; use it as a gentle hook: "Your AutoTrader review says you're very responsive — but my enquiry didn't get a callback in 24 hours. We fix exactly that so no lead slips through."

### Website (aoauto.co.za)
- **Tagline:** "Your Destination For Quality Cars" / "Your Trusted Partner in Providing You with Quality Pre-Owned Vehicles."
- **About:** Focus on customer satisfaction first, enjoyable honest service, quality product.
- **Takeaway:** They care about reputation. One missed lead = one bad review waiting to happen. Frame Intellidial as protecting that.

## Template used
**Template A** — Your enquiry (24 hours, no response) + gentle contrast with their only review ("very responsive") so it doesn't feel accusatory — "one slipped through, we fix that."

## Email draft — SEND THIS ONE

**Subject:** my BMW 1 Series enquiry on AutoTrader

```
Hi David,

I enquired about your 2011 BMW 1 Series 116i on AutoTrader last night (16 February) — 24 hours later, no callback.

Your only AutoTrader review says you're "very responsive," so I'm guessing this one slipped through — busy period, or the lead landed in the wrong place. That's exactly what I built a fix for.

Intellidial calls your leads back within 60 seconds — any hour, any day. AI qualifies the buyer, answers questions about the car, and books a viewing into your calendar. You get a notification: qualified warm lead, confirmed time slot. Every lead gets a call, none slip through.

Would this be useful for AO Auto Traders?

## Alternate subject lines

| Subject | Notes |
|---------|-------|

| `BMW 116i enquiry — no callback` | More direct |
| `your AutoTrader leads` | Short, curiosity |

## Follow-up schedule

| When | Action |
|------|--------|
| **Day 3** | Bump: "Just floating this to the top in case it got buried. Happy to close the loop if it's not relevant." |
| **Day 7** | Send Loom demo link (90-second walkthrough). |
| **Day 14** | Breakup: "Last note from me. If speed-to-lead isn't a priority now, no worries. If things change, I'm here." |

## Notes
- **Don't attack.** They have one review and it's positive ("very responsive"). The email assumes the best — "this one slipped through" — and offers a fix. No "your reviews say X but you didn't call me" finger-wagging.
- **Small operation** — 8 listings, one visible contact (David). He's likely the decision maker. One reply = one conversation.
- **Their tagline** ("customer satisfaction first") — if they reply, you can tie back: "This keeps every lead from becoming a missed-sale or a bad review."
