- **Reviews:** Visible reviews are positive: AutoTrader Customer (30 Jan 2025) "Great service. Very fast, efficient, great service overall."; AutoTrader Customer (8 May 2025) "Professional service and quick response. Dealt with **Mo the sales manager**. No complaints."; Michael S (4 Nov 2025) "Knowledgeable and friendly, great customer service. **Mo was super helpful and informative, easy to work with and communicated well.**" 5% 1-star and 5% 2-star but **content not visible** — no usable "no response" quote.

## Template used
**Template A only** — "I enquired and you didn't call back." No quote from their reviews (visible ones praise Mo and quick response; 5% 1-star / 5% 2-star but no snippet). Angle: your missed callback + "even when you're on the ball, leads slip through when someone's busy or it's after hours" + IntelliDial calls every lead back in 60 seconds so nobody slips through.

**Subject:** my Mercedes C-Class C200 enquiry on AutoTrader

Hi DS Cars team,

I enquired about your 2018 Mercedes-Benz C-Class C200 AMG Line Auto on AutoTrader on 19 February — no callback.

DS Cars has a solid rep — reviews mention "quick response" and "great customer service." Even so, leads slip through when someone's busy or it's after hours. I built IntelliDial to catch those: we call your leads back within 60 seconds, even while your whole team is off. AI qualifies the buyer, answers questions about the car, and books a viewing straight into your calendar. You get a notification with a qualified warm lead and a confirmed time slot — no lead left waiting.

Can I show you what this looks like for one of your leads?
