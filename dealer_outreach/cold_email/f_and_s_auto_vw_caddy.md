## Email draft — SEND THIS ONE

**Subject:** my VW Caddy 2.0TDI Panel Van enquiry on AutoTrader

```
Hi F&S Auto team,

I enquired about your 2016 VW Caddy Maxi 2.0TDI Panel Van on AutoTrader on 19 February — no callback.

I noticed one of your AutoTrader reviews: "When you call them their phone rings with no answer they don't call you back." With 88 cars on AutoTrader, every enquiry that slips through is a missed sale. I built IntelliDial to fix exactly this: we call your leads back within 60 seconds, any hour, any day. AI qualifies the buyer, answers questions about the car, and books a viewing straight into your calendar. You get a notification with a qualified warm lead and a confirmed time slot — no more unanswered calls.

Worth a look for F&S Auto?
