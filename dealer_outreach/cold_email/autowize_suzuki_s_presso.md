## Research summary

### AutoTrader
- **Rating:** 3.2 stars (2 reviewers) — 50% one-star, 50% five-star. Polarised.
- **Reviews used for angle:**
  - **Charles D** (08 Oct 2025), 1 star: *"They didn't contact me"*
  - **Elaine L** (28 Mar 2025), 5 stars: *"Autowize Excellence"* — "Extremely rapid response to my enquiry. Following up with more options and looking out for any other deals. 10/10"
- **Takeaway:** When they respond, they're great (Elaine). When they don't, they lose the lead (Charles D). Your no-callback + Charles D = strong fit. IntelliDial = every lead gets a call so the next Charles doesn't leave a 1-star.

### Google
- **Rating:** 4.0 stars (26 reviews). Bergvliet, Cape Town.
- **Takeaway:** Don't need to reference Google; AutoTrader Charles D is the clearest lead-follow-up angle.

---

## Template used
**Template A + B** — "I enquired and you didn't call back" + Charles D "They didn't contact me". Optional nuance: when you respond you're excellent (Elaine); the fix is making sure every lead gets that response.

Hi Autowize team,

I enquired about your 2022 Suzuki S-Presso 1.0 GL Manual on AutoTrader on 18 February — no callback.

One of your AutoTrader reviews says: "They didn't contact me." Another buyer gave you 5 stars for "Extremely rapid response" — so when you reach the lead, you're great; the gap is when one slips through. I built IntelliDial to close that gap: it calls your leads back within 60 seconds, even at 9pm on a Friday. AI qualifies the buyer, answers questions about the car, and books a viewing into your calendar. You get a notification with the qualified warm lead and confirmed time slot. Just forward the leads email to us.

Would this be useful for Autowize?

| Subject | Notes |
|---------|-------|
| `my Suzuki S-Presso enquiry on AutoTrader` | **Recommended** — specific, low-key |
| `Suzuki S-Presso enquiry — no callback` | More direct |
| `They didn't contact me — I built a fix` | Ties to Charles D; use if you want to be more direct |

## Follow-up schedule

| When | Action |
|------|--------|
| **Day 3** | Bump: "Just floating this to the top in case it got buried. Happy to close the loop if it's not relevant." |
| **Day 7** | Send Loom demo link (90-second walkthrough). Mention: "9 cars on AutoTrader — every enquiry could get a call in 60 seconds." |
| **Day 14** | Breakup: "Last note from me. If speed-to-lead isn't a priority now, no worries. If things change, I'm here." |

## Notes
- **Charles D "They didn't contact me"** — Direct lead-follow-up complaint; perfect for IntelliDial. You don't name him; the quote speaks for itself.
- **Elaine L** — "Extremely rapid response" shows they can deliver. Framing: "when you get to the lead you're great; the gap is when the lead slips through" is constructive, not attack.
- **9 cars, 20+ years** — Family run, Bergvliet. Every lead matters. Same Cape Town dealer pool as your other emails.
