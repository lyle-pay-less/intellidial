## Bottom Line

### Revenue Potential:
- **Conservative:** R169,980/month (R2.04M/year)
- **Optimistic:** R381,980/month (R4.58M/year)

### Is 20 Users Possible?
**YES** - With:
1. ✅ Your current pricing tiers (Starter/Growth/Pro/Enterprise)
2. ✅ Free pilot program (removes risk)
3. ✅ Focused outreach (high-volume outbound companies)
4. ✅ Clear ROI messaging
5. ✅ 3-6 month timeline

### Key Success Factors:
- **Target the right companies** (they make calls daily)
- **Show immediate ROI** (R5-15 saved per call)
- **Remove risk** (free pilot, no credit card)
- **Focus on high-volume users** (they need it most)

**You can absolutely land 20 users and generate R170K-380K/month MRR.**

**Note:** Your pricing gap: Companies needing 2,000-4,000 calls/month will need Enterprise (R39,999 for 10,000 calls) - this is actually good as it maximizes revenue per customer. Consider offering a "Business" tier at R19,999 for 3,000 calls if Enterprise feels too expensive for some prospects.
