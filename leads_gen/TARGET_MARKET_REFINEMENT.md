# Target Market Refinement — Before Finding Emails

We refine **who** to target using six criteria. Only after we lock this do we build the plan to find contact emails. No point chasing leads in segments that don’t fit.

**Our offer (for context):** AI phone research — scrape lists, call at scale with voice AI, get structured data + recordings. Replaces or augments manual calling.

## 1. The six criteria

Use these to score industries/segments. High score = priority target before we search for emails.

| # | Criterion | What it means |
|---|-----------|----------------|
| 1 | **Easy to implement** | They can try us with minimal setup: no long integration, no heavy IT, no RFP. We plug into how they already work (list in → calls out → data back). |
| 2 | **Low business risk** | Trying us is low risk for them: not regulated calls (e.g. not debt collection, medical advice), not high-stakes compliance. They can pilot without legal/security drama. |
| 3 | **Big time saver** | The task we automate takes real hours today. Clear “X hours → Y minutes” or “N calls/day → 10× N.” They feel the time pain. |
| 4 | **Better data quality** | We don’t just speed things up — we give more consistent, structured, usable data (e.g. fields in a sheet, recordings, summaries) than ad‑hoc manual notes. |
| 5 | **Save on overheads** | Obvious cost down: fewer FTEs on phones, or same volume with less overtime/contractors. Finance or ops can see the saving. |
| 6 | **Business prone to do this manually** | They already do this work by hand (calls, research, list updates). We’re not inventing a new workflow — we’re replacing one they already have and dislike. |

**Rule of thumb:** If a segment scores high on **1, 2, 3, 6** and at least one of **4 or 5**, it’s a candidate. Then we find emails for that segment.

---

## 2. How we’ll score

- **H / M / L** = High / Medium / Low fit for that criterion.  
- **—** = weak fit or not applicable.

We’ll run this across several industries and then pick the top 2–3 before building the “find emails” plan.

## 3. Industries / segments — scored

### 3.1 Recruiters & staffing agencies

| Criterion | Score | Notes |
|-----------|--------|------|
| Easy to implement | H | List of candidates/companies → we call; they get notes/data. Simple. |
| Low business risk | H | General outreach/screening; not regulated advice. |
| Big time saver | H | Calling is the job; volume is huge. |
| Better data quality | H | Structured “did they answer, key points, next step” beats scribbled notes. |
| Save on overheads | H | Direct substitute for recruiter call time. |
| Prone to do manually | H | They live on the phone. |

**Overall:** **Tier 1** — refine further (e.g. tech recruiters, volume staffing, RPOs).

---

### 3.2 Sales / SDR teams (outbound B2B)

| Criterion | Score | Notes |
|-----------|--------|------|
| Easy to implement | H | Lead list in → calls/qualification out; fits cadences. |
| Low business risk | M | Need to stay within cold-calling rules; we’re research/qual, not hard sell. |
| Big time saver | H | Dials per day, follow-ups, research calls. |
| Better data quality | H | Consistent qualification fields, call summaries. |
| Save on overheads | H | More pipeline per SDR or fewer SDRs. |
| Prone to do manually | H | Core activity is calling. |

**Overall:** **Tier 1** — especially SMB/growth teams with one decision‑maker.

---

### 3.3 Market research / panel / surveys (phone)

| Criterion | Score | Notes |
|-----------|--------|------|
| Easy to implement | M | May need script alignment; still “list → calls → data.” |

| Big time saver | H | High volume of calls. |
| Better data quality | H | Structured answers, recordings. |
| Save on overheads | H | Replace dialers / phone room. |
| Prone to do manually | H | Still done by phone today. |

| Big time saver | H | Hundreds of locations = hundreds of calls. |
| Better data quality | H | Same questions, same fields, comparable data. |
| Save on overheads | H | No need for field or phone staff to do it. |
| Prone to do manually | H | Often done by HQ or regional managers calling. |

**Overall:** **Tier 1** — e.g. dental/medical practices, gyms, salons, franchise ops.

---

### 3.5 Lead qualification / appointment setting (for agencies or in-house)

| Criterion | Score | Notes |
|-----------|--------|------|
| Easy to implement | H | List in → qualified leads / appointments out. |
| Low business risk | M | Same as SDR; position as research/qual, not cold sell. |
| Big time saver | H | Core job is calling. |
| Better data quality | H | Clear “qualified / not / callback” + notes. |
| Save on overheads | H | Replace or augment BDRs. |
| Prone to do manually | H | Done manually everywhere. |

**Overall:** **Tier 1** — agencies selling “appointment setting” or “lead gen” are ideal.

### 3.6 Debt collection / receivables (calls)

| Criterion | Score | Notes |

| Easy to implement | M | Integration and scripts matter. |
| Low business risk | **L** | Highly regulated; compliance and liability are high. |
| Big time saver | H | Very high volume. |
| Better data quality | M | Useful but compliance dominates. |
| Save on overheads | H | Yes. |

| Easy to implement | H | List → calls → interested/not, notes. |
| Low business risk | M | Depends on region (e.g. DNC, consent). |
| Big time saver | H | Agents call constantly. |
| Better data quality | H | Structured outcomes. |
| Save on overheads | M | Often commission-based; “overhead” less clear. |
| Prone to do manually | H | Very manual. |

**Overall:** **Tier 2** — good; watch local cold-calling rules.

| Prone to do manually | M | Some do; some use surveys only. |

**Overall:** **Tier 2** — good for “customer research” or “feedback calls” use cases.

---

## 4. Refined shortlist (before we find emails)

**Tier 1 — priority (run “find emails” for these first):**

1. **Recruiters & staffing** — tech recruiters, volume staffing, RPOs.
2. **Sales / SDR teams** — SMB and growth-stage; outbound B2B.
3. **Local / multi-location** — franchises, multi-site clinics, retail; HQ or ops doing “call all locations.”
4. **Lead qual / appointment setting** — agencies or in-house BDR teams.

**Tier 2 — next:**

5. Market research / panel (phone surveys).
6. Real estate (where cold calling is allowed).
7. SaaS / tech (customer research, feedback calls).

**Tier 3 — not yet:**

- Debt collection, healthcare/medical, insurance (regulatory and risk).

---

## 5. Next step: find contact emails

Only after we **choose 1–2 segments** from Tier 1 (and optionally one from Tier 2):

1. Define **job titles** and **company types** (e.g. “Head of Recruitment,” “VP Sales,” “Operations Manager”; company size, industry).
2. Build the **“find emails” plan** (sources, enrichment, verification) for that segment.
3. Then run lead discovery and feed the outreach pipeline.

**Suggested first pick:** Recruiters & staffing **or** Lead qual / appointment-setting agencies. Both are manual-call-heavy, easy to implement, low risk, and clear on time/cost/data — so they fit all six criteria and set us up for a clean “find emails” plan next.
