# Why these Apollo filters — so we don’t waste time on uninterested leads

**What we offer (Intellidial):** AI does outbound phone calls at scale—qualify leads, book appointments, run surveys, verify data. You get the same (or more) volume with less labour, structured data, and recordings.

**Who actually cares:** Someone who *already runs or pays for* a lot of outbound calls and feels the pain (cost, time, inconsistency). They don’t need to be convinced that “calling matters”—they know. We’re offering to do it faster, cheaper, and with better data.

**Who doesn’t care (avoid):** Companies that barely call, or where calls are one-off/support; heavily regulated (debt collection, medical advice); too small (no budget); or huge (6‑month RFP). Don’t chase them.

## 1. Industry — why these

We only want industries where **outbound calling is core to how they operate** (or a big part of it). They already have the pain; we’re the solution.

| Industry / segment | Why they’re a fit |
|--------------------|--------------------|
| **Lead gen / appointment setting** | Their product is literally “we make calls to book meetings.” Volume is high, margins depend on efficiency. They get the value of automation immediately. |
| **Telemarketing / cold calling** | Same: calls *are* the business. They think in cost-per-call and conversion. AI that keeps volume and cuts labour is a direct win. |
| **Market research / fieldwork** | Phone surveys at scale. They already run call centres or diallers. Structured data + recordings is exactly what they need. |
| **Recruitment / staffing** | Recruiters live on the phone (screening, scheduling). High volume, time = money. They already use ATS/CRMs; adding AI calling is a natural step. |
| **BPO / call centre (outbound)** | They sell outbound capacity. More efficiency = more margin or more accounts. Decision-makers are ops/call centre managers who feel daily pain. |
| **Customer onboarding / welcome calls** | Companies that call every new customer. Volume scales with signups. They want consistency and data—we provide both. |
| **Appointment reminders / booking** | Clinics, salons, etc. that confirm by phone. Repetitive, high volume. Easy to pilot and see ROI. |
| **Data verification / database cleanup** | They call to verify or update records. Boring, high-volume work. Ideal for AI: scripted, structured outcome. |
| **Property / listing verification** | Estate agents or platforms that verify listings by phone. Again: scripted, volume, structured data. |
| **Lead qualification / SDR services** | They qualify leads by phone. They already value “more pipeline, fewer bodies.” They understand tools and will trial. |

**Industries we skip (or deprioritise):** Pure product companies with no outbound team; regulated collections/legal; healthcare where calls are clinical; huge enterprises with no single buyer. They either don’t feel the pain or we can’t get to a decision quickly.

## 2. Company size — why 10–200 (or 10–100)

- **Why not &lt; 10:** Too small. Often no dedicated “calling team,” no budget for tools, founder does everything. Low volume, low willingness to pay. High chase, low close.
- **Why 10–200:** They have enough volume to feel the pain (calls per day matter). They have a manager or director who owns it. Budget exists for tools. Decisions are often 1–2 people, not a committee. **Sweet spot.**
- **Why not 200+ (or 500+):** Procurement, legal, security. Long sales cycles. We’re not enterprise-ready yet. Better to win 10–200 and scale later.

So: **Company size 10–200** (or 10–100 for niche segments) = enough calls + enough budget + someone who can say yes without a 6‑month RFP.

---

## 3. Job titles — why these

We want people who **own the outcome** of calling (volume, quality, cost) or **own the budget** for the team that does it. They feel the pain and can buy.

| Title type | Why |
|------------|-----|
| **Head of Recruitment / Recruitment Manager / Talent Acquisition** | Owns recruiter productivity. Calls = core. They care about time per candidate, consistency, data. |
| **Founder / CEO** | In 10–50 person agencies they often *are* the decision-maker. They feel cost and chaos directly. |
| **Sales Director / VP Sales / Head of Demand Gen** | Owns pipeline and SDR output. More qualified leads with same (or less) headcount = their KPI. |
| **Call Centre Manager / Operations Manager / Contact Centre Manager** | Owns the dialler, the team, the SLA. They live cost-per-call and quality. They’ll trial if it makes their numbers better. |

**Titles we skip:** IT, HR (unless HR does high-volume recruiting), generic “Manager” with no link to calling or sales. They might be reachable but they don’t feel *this* pain.

**Seniority:** Manager, Director, VP, C-Level, Owner, Founder. We need someone who can say “yes” or “let’s pilot,” not “I’ll need to ask.”

## 4. Keywords — why these

Keywords are **signals that they already do outbound / volume calling**. We’re not teaching them that “calling matters”—we’re showing up where it already does.

- **“Appointment setting”, “lead generation”, “demand generation”, “outbound agency”** → Their offer is literally calls/meetings. They get automation.
- **“Telemarketing”, “cold calling”, “telesales”** → They sell or run call operations. Cost and volume are top of mind.
- **“Market research”, “fieldwork”, “phone surveys”** → They run surveys by phone. Data quality and cost matter.
- **“BPO”, “call centre”, “contact centre”, “outbound”** → They sell or run outbound capacity. Efficiency = margin.
- **“Lead qualification”, “SDR services”, “sales development”** → They qualify by phone. They already use tools; we’re the next tool.

If we search only “industry” with no keywords we get everyone in that industry—including people who never pick up the phone. Keywords **narrow to the ones who already care about call volume and process.**

---

## 5. Location — why Cape Town (or South Africa)

- **Cape Town:** Your focus. Local time zone, local market, easier to pilot and support. If volume is too low, open to **South Africa**.
- **Why not global yet:** Different regulations, time zones, and “we’re local” is a trust signal. Nail one geography first.

---

## 6. Value add (what we say to them)

One-line pitch: **“You already run a lot of outbound calls. We run them with AI—same or more volume, less labour, structured data and recordings. So you save time and cost without losing quality.”**

- **For lead gen / telemarketing:** “More calls per day with the same team, or the same calls with fewer people.”
- **For market research:** “Same surveys, same data quality, with AI doing the dialling and capture.”
- **For recruitment:** “Screen and schedule more candidates without more recruiters on the phone.”
- **For appointment / reminder:** “Confirmations and reminders done by AI; your staff focus on in-person.”

If they don’t do volume calling, this pitch doesn’t land. That’s why we filter **industry + keywords + size + job title**—so we only talk to people for whom this is already true.

## Summary: how this avoids wasted time

| Filter | Role in not wasting time |
|--------|---------------------------|
| **Industry** | Only sectors where calling at scale is core. No “maybe they call sometimes.” |
| **Company size** | 10–200 = enough volume + budget + fast decision. No 2-person or 2000-person. |
| **Job titles** | Only people who own calling / ops / sales and can say yes. No IT or random managers. |
| **Keywords** | Only companies that *say* they do outbound/lead gen/telemarketing/surveys. No guessing. |
| **Location** | Cape Town / SA = your focus. No chasing cold leads in other countries yet. |

Result: **Fewer leads, but leads who already have the problem we solve.** Higher reply rate, higher trial rate, less time chasing people who were never going to care.
