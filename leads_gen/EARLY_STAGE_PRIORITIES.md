# Early Stage Priorities — Product Focus with Scalable Sales

**Strategy:** Use demo agents + self-serve trials to handle customer acquisition while you focus on product improvements.

**Timeline:** Months 1-3 (early stage)

---

## The Scalable Approach

### Your Focus: Product Development (80% of time)

**Why this works:**
- Demo agents handle Pro/Growth demos → you don't do demos
- Self-serve trials handle Starter/Growth → automated conversion
- You focus on building → better product → easier to sell later

**Result:** Better product + scalable sales = sustainable growth

---

## Month 1-3: Product Priorities

### Week 1-2: Self-Serve Trial Flow (CRITICAL)

**Why:** Eliminates 80% of demos, lets customers try without you

**Build:**
- [ ] Landing page "Start Free Trial" button
- [ ] Signup flow → Account creation (Firebase Auth)
- [ ] Auto-add 50 free calls to new accounts
- [ ] Simple onboarding wizard:
  - Step 1: "What's your use case?" (dropdown)
  - Step 2: "Upload your list or we'll generate one"
  - Step 3: "Create your first project"
- [ ] Email automation:
  - Welcome email (immediate)
  - "How's your trial going?" (Day 2)
  - "Upgrade to Growth" (Day 5)
  - "Book a call if you need help" (Day 7)

**Impact:** Customers can try without demo → you focus on product

---

### Week 3-4: Demo Agent Setup

**Why:** Scale demos without doing them yourself

**Setup:**
- [ ] Define commission structure (20% MRR)
- [ ] Create demo script template
- [ ] Set up lead tracking (spreadsheet or simple CRM)
- [ ] Post job listing (Upwork, LinkedIn)
- [ ] Screen & hire first agent

**Impact:** Agent handles Pro/Growth demos → you focus on product

---

### Month 2: Product Improvements

**Focus:** Fix issues, improve UX, add features based on trial feedback

**Priorities:**
1. **Trial user feedback:**
   - What confused them?
   - What features are missing?
   - What would make them upgrade?

2. **Core product improvements:**
   - Better onboarding flow
   - Clearer project creation
   - Better results visualization
   - Export improvements (Excel formatting)

3. **Conversion optimizations:**
   - Upgrade prompts in dashboard
   - Usage tracking ("You've used 45/50 calls")
   - Success metrics ("You've saved 12 hours")

**Impact:** Better product → higher trial conversion → less need for demos

---

### Month 3: Scale & Refine

**Focus:** Hire second agent, improve product based on paying customers

**Priorities:**
1. **Customer success:**
   - Onboarding for paying customers
   - Support documentation
   - FAQ/help center

2. **Product features:**
   - Features requested by paying customers
   - Integrations (if needed)
   - Performance improvements

3. **Sales process:**
   - Refine demo script based on what works
   - Improve qualification process
   - Optimize commission structure

**Impact:** Better product + better sales process = sustainable growth
