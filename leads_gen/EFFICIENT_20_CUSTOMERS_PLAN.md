# Most Efficient Path to 20 Customers

**Goal:** 20 paying customers with minimal demo burden  
**Timeline:** 3-4 months  
**Approach:** Self-serve trials + demo agents + product focus

> **💡 Early Stage Strategy:** Use demo agents + self-serve trials to scale sales while you focus 75% of your time on product improvements. See **`EARLY_STAGE_PRIORITIES.md`** for the product-focused roadmap.
>
> **💡 Demo Agents:** See **`DEMO_AGENT_COMMISSION_PLAN.md`** for hiring commission-based demo agents to handle Pro/Growth demos while you focus on Enterprise + product.

## The Efficient Strategy

### Core Principle: Self-Serve First, Demo Only When Needed

**Starter/Growth Plans (R999-R2,999):** Self-serve trial → no demo needed  
**Pro/Enterprise Plans (R8,999+):** Live demo → higher conversion

---

## Plan Splits (20 Customers)

### Scenario 1: Conservative Mix (RECOMMENDED)

| Plan | Customers | Price/Month | MRR | % of Total |
|------|-----------|-------------|-----|------------|
| **Starter** | 3 | R999 | R2,997 | 1.8% |
| **Growth** | 8 | R2,999 | R23,992 | 14.1% |
| **Pro** | 7 | R8,999 | R62,993 | 37.1% |
| **Enterprise** | 2 | R39,999 | R79,998 | 47.0% |
| **TOTAL** | **20** | | **R169,980** | **100%** |

**Key insight:** Enterprise (2 customers) = 47% of revenue. Focus demos here.

---

## Efficient Acquisition Funnel

### Step 1: Lead Generation (400 qualified leads)

**Sources:**
- Apollo searches: 200 companies (lead gen, telemarketing, market research)
- LinkedIn outreach: 100 connections
- Referrals: 50 leads
- Content/inbound: 50 leads

**Qualification:** Use `LEAD_QUALIFICATION_PROCESS.md` scoring (minimum 6/10)

---

### Step 2: Routing by Plan Tier

```
400 Qualified Leads
    ↓
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Qualification Score + Intent             │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Score ≥ 8 + High Volume (1000+ calls)  │
│   → Live Demo (40 demos)                │
│   → Target: Pro/Enterprise              │
│   → Convert: 9 customers                │
│                                         │
│ Score 6-7 + Medium Volume (100-1000)   │
│   → Self-Serve Trial (200 trials)      │
│   → Target: Starter/Growth             │
│   → Convert: 11 customers              │
│                                         │
│ Score < 6 or Low Intent                 │
│   → Pre-recorded Video (160 views)      │
│   → Nurture → Some convert later        │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Step 3: Conversion Paths

#### Path A: Self-Serve Trial (Starter/Growth) — NO DEMO NEEDED

**Process:**
1. Lead clicks "Start Free Trial" on landing page
2. Signs up → Gets 50 free calls automatically
3. Creates project → Uploads list or uses lead gen
4. AI calls run → Results in dashboard
5. After trial: "Upgrade to Growth (R2,999/month)"

**Conversion:**
- 200 trials → 40 active users (20%) → 11 paying customers (27.5% of active)
- **Your time:** 0 hours (automated)

**Expected plans:**
- 3 × Starter (R999)
- 8 × Growth (R2,999)

---

#### Path B: Live Demo (Pro/Enterprise) — STRATEGIC DEMOS ONLY

**Process:**
1. High-intent lead (score ≥ 8, 1000+ calls/day)
2. Qualification call: "How many calls? Current process? Budget?"
3. If qualified → Book 30-min demo
4. Demo → Custom proposal → Close

**Conversion:**
- 40 demos → 9 customers (22.5% conversion)
- **Your time:** 40 hours (1 hour per demo)

**Expected plans:**
- 7 × Pro (R8,999)
- 2 × Enterprise (R39,999)

## Cost Structure

**Your time:** 10 hours over 4 months = **0.6 hours/week** on demos (highly scalable!)
