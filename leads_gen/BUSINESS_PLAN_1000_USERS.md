**Company retained:** R44M/year for growth, investments, or future dividends

### Path to 2,000 Users:
Once you hit 1,000 users, the path to 2,000 becomes easier:
- Inbound marketing is mature (300+ leads/month)
- Referral program is self-sustaining
- Partnership channel is established
- Enterprise sales process is proven
- Brand recognition is strong
- **Timeline:** 12-18 additional months to reach 2,000 users

## The Big Picture

At 1,000 customers, you're running a **R100M+ ARR SaaS business**:

### Reality Check: Customer Count vs Revenue

**You're absolutely right** - 1,000 customers is quite common for SaaS companies. What matters is **revenue, not customer count**:

- **B2C SaaS:** Often have 10,000+ customers at $10-50/month
- **SMB SaaS:** Often have 1,000-10,000 customers at $50-500/month  
- **Mid-market SaaS:** Often have 100-1,000 customers at $500-5,000/month
- **Enterprise SaaS:** Often have 10-100 customers at $5,000-50,000/month

**Your model:** Mix of SMB + Mid-market + Enterprise
- **Average revenue per customer:** R8,499/month (R102K/year)
- **This is actually quite good** - higher than most SMB SaaS companies

### Revenue Benchmarks (More Realistic)

**R102M ARR (~$5.4M USD ARR):**
- ✅ **Solid SaaS business** - profitable and sustainable
- ✅ **Top 10-15%** of SaaS companies (not top 1%)
- ✅ **Significant market presence** in SA
- ✅ **Strong cash flow** for growth or exit
- ✅ **Personal wealth:** R3.2M/year take-home + R44M+ retained in company
- ✅ **Team:** 30-40 employees
- ✅ **Impact:** Helping 1,000 companies scale their operations

**For context:**
- **Top 1% SaaS:** $50M+ ARR (unicorn territory)
- **Top 5% SaaS:** $20M+ ARR
- **Top 10% SaaS:** $5M+ ARR ← **You're here**
- **Top 25% SaaS:** $1M+ ARR
- **Most SaaS companies:** < $1M ARR

### What Makes This Impressive

1. **High average revenue per customer** (R8,499/month)
2. **Strong unit economics** (R7M/month profit)
3. **Sustainable growth** (inbound + referrals + partnerships)
4. **Market leadership** in SA (local focus, local numbers)
5. **Profitable** (not burning cash like many SaaS companies)

**Bottom line:** While 1,000 customers is common, **R102M ARR with R7M/month profit** is a **very strong SaaS business** - well above average and puts you in the top 10-15% of SaaS companies globally.
