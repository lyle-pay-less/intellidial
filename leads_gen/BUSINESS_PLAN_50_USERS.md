# Business Plan: Getting to 50 Paying Users

**Goal:** Acquire 50 paying customers within 6-12 months
**Target:** High-volume outbound call companies (lead gen, telemarketing, market research)

> **⚠️ Demo Burden Concern:** This plan assumes 300 demos → 50 customers. See **`REDUCE_DEMO_BURDEN_STRATEGY.md`** for strategies to reduce demos by 60-70% (300 → 100 demos) using self-serve trials, pre-recorded videos, and better qualification.

## Cost Structure

### Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)

| Channel | Cost | Duration | Total Cost |
|---------|------|----------|------------|
| **Apollo (Pro)** | R500/month | 12 months | R6,000 |
| **LinkedIn Sales Nav** | R1,200/month | 12 months | R14,400 |
| **Google Ads** | R10,000/month | 6 months | R60,000 |

| **Partnerships** | R5,000/month | 6 months | R30,000 |
| **Tools/Software** | R1,000/month | 12 months | R12,000 |
| **Total** | | | **R178,400** |

**CAC per customer:** R178,400 ÷ 50 = **R3,568 per customer**

**Payback period:** R3,568 ÷ R7,999 (avg MRR) = **0.45 months** (very fast!)

### Operating Costs (Monthly)

| Item | Cost/Month | Notes |
|------|------------|-------|
| **VAPI (calls)** | R50,000* | 50,000 calls/month across all customers |
| **Gemini API** | R2,000 | Higher usage with more customers |
| **Phone numbers** | R2,000 | More orgs = more numbers |

*VAPI cost varies: R0.05-0.15/min × avg 3-5 min = R0.15-0.75/call. Assuming R1/call average.

**Net profit (Scenario 1):** R399,950 - R65,000 = **R334,950/month**
