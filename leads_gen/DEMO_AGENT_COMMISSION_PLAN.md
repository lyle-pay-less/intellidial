# Demo Agent Commission Plan — Scale Demos Without Doing Them All

**Goal:** Hire and train demo agents to handle demos, pay commission on conversions.

**Your role:** Train agents, manage leads, handle Enterprise deals, focus on product/business.

---

## Commission Structure

### Option 1: Percentage of MRR (RECOMMENDED)

**Commission:** 20% of first-year MRR (paid monthly)

| Plan | MRR | Commission/Month | Annual Commission |
|------|-----|------------------|-------------------|
| **Starter** | R999 | R200 | R2,400 |
| **Growth** | R2,999 | R600 | R7,200 |
| **Pro** | R8,999 | R1,800 | R21,600 |
| **Enterprise** | R39,999 | R8,000 | R96,000 |

**Why this works:**
- Agents motivated to sell higher plans (Pro/Enterprise)
- Ongoing commission = retention focus
- You keep 80% of revenue
- Scales with growth

---

### Option 2: One-Time Commission (Simpler)

**Commission:** 2-3x monthly MRR (one-time payment)

| Plan | MRR | Commission (2x) | Commission (3x) |
|------|-----|-----------------|-----------------|
| **Starter** | R999 | R1,998 | R2,997 |
| **Growth** | R2,999 | R5,998 | R8,997 |
| **Pro** | R8,999 | R17,998 | R26,997 |
| **Enterprise** | R39,999 | R79,998 | R119,997 |

**Why this works:**
- Simpler accounting (one payment)
- Agents get paid immediately
- You don't track ongoing commissions

**Recommendation:** Use Option 1 (20% MRR) for Pro/Enterprise, Option 2 (2x MRR) for Starter/Growth.

Before I show you the product, let me understand your needs:

- What's the biggest pain point? (Time? Cost? Consistency?)
```

- Identify which plan fits (Starter/Growth/Pro/Enterprise)

### Demo (10 min)

## Lead Distribution System

### How Leads Get Assigned

**Option 1: Round-Robin (Fair)**
- Leads assigned in rotation
- Agent 1 → Agent 2 → Agent 3 → repeat
- Simple, fair distribution

**Option 2: Performance-Based (Motivates)**
- Top performers get more leads
- Conversion rate > 20% → get priority
- Rewards good agents

**Option 3: Specialization (Best)**
- Agent A: Focuses on Pro/Enterprise (high-value)
- Agent B: Focuses on Growth (volume)
- Agent C: Handles inbound/self-serve upgrades

**Recommendation:** Start with Round-Robin, move to Specialization as you scale.
