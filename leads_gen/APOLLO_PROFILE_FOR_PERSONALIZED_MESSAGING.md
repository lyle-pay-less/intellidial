## Customer pain points *

```
Teams that do high-volume phone outreach (recruiters, SDRs, lead qual agencies, multi-location ops) spend hours every day on repetitive calls. Manual calling is slow, inconsistent, and hard to scale. Notes are scribbled or lost; data is messy and doesn't slot into CRM or sheets. Hiring more dialers is expensive and doesn't fix quality or consistency.
```

**Short version (if character limit):**

```
Repetitive, high-volume phone outreach is slow and doesn't scale. Manual callers burn time, notes are inconsistent, and data doesn't land in CRM or spreadsheets. Adding more dialers is costly and doesn't fix quality.

## Value proposition *

```
Intelli Dial automates phone research at scale: give us a list, we call with AI voice, and you get structured data plus recordings. Same questions every time, consistent fields (e.g. availability, pricing, next step), and results in Excel or your stack. Cut call time and cost while improving data quality—no extra headcount.

## Company overview (Offering) *

```
Intelli Dial is an AI-powered phone research platform. We scrape or ingest contact lists, place outbound calls using voice AI (VAPI), and return structured data plus recordings. Use cases include lead qualification, appointment setting, availability checks, and list verification. Results are delivered in Excel (or integrated into your workflow) with transcripts and optional Gemini-powered analysis. We offer a calling pipeline (Python) and a marketing site with a live voice demo. Target customers: recruiters, staffing agencies, SDR/outbound teams, lead gen and appointment-setting agencies, and businesses with multi-location or high-call-volume operations.

- Consistent data: same questions, same fields, ready for Excel or CRM—no manual note-taking.
- Voice AI (VAPI): natural conversations, not rigid IVR; transcripts and optional AI analysis (e.g. Gemini).
- Built for B2B use cases: lead qual, recruitment screening, appointment setting, multi-location research.
- Pilot-friendly: small batch to prove ROI before scaling.
