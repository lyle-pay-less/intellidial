# South African Debt Companies to Target — Analysis

**Purpose:** List of debt collection companies in SA that Intellidial can target, with priority order (small first, then mid-size). Use this for outreach once you're ready to run the debt angle.

**Related:** `gemini research` in this folder — fuller strategic analysis (macro context, regulatory framework, company profiles, legal-collection hybrids, tech stack, outreach tiers). This doc is the actionable target list; Gemini research is the deep context.

## 1. From existing debt_outbound research (already in this folder)

| Company | Scale | Why target (or not) |
|---------|--------|----------------------|
| **Nimble Group** | ~1,500 agents, 300K calls/day, Cape Town + 5 countries | Too big for first pilots; long enterprise cycle. Use as "we help collectors like you scale" later. |
| **ITC** | Mid-size | Good after 1–2 small pilots; enterprise-style sales. |
| **MBD** | Enterprise | Same as ITC — later, with proof. |
| **VVM** | Mid-size (uses Smartz Communications) | Mid-size; good once you have case studies. |
| **Collect 4U** | Mid-size | Same — mid-size, not "first 5" target. |

**Note:** HOW_TO_BREAK_IN.md says "Target small collectors (QuickDebt, NVDB, Smart Collections) not Nimble" — those names are placeholders. The real list is below and from CFDC/Brabys.

## 3. Tier 2: Mid-tier + legal-collection hybrids (after 1–2 small pilots)

| Company | Location | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| **Bredell Ferreira** | Pretoria / CT / JHB | bredellferreira.co.za — 10–49 employees, 1,700+ clients (construction, logistics, property). "Revenue strategy" positioning. |

## 4. How to find more names

| Source | URL | Use |
|--------|-----|-----|
| **CFDC Active Register** | https://www.cfdc.org.za/active-register/ | Search by company name, registration number, or location. Only registered collectors can collect debt — everyone here is a valid target. Filter by city (e.g. Cape Town, Johannesburg) and infer size from branch count if shown. |
| **Brabys** | https://www.brabys.com/za/debt-collectors | "Debt collectors" by region. List companies by area, then cross-check with CFDC and LinkedIn to guess size (employees, branches). |
| **Swordfish customers** | Swordfish is used by many small/mid collectors. We don't have their customer list; if we partner with them or meet one Swordfish user, that's a segment (same tech stack, same integration story). |
| **LinkedIn** | Search "debt collector" / "debt collection" + "South Africa", filter by company size (e.g. 11–50, 51–200). Use company names to verify on CFDC and find contact details. |

---

## 5. Practical first list (small-first)

Use this order for initial outreach (Tier 1 small-first):

1. PRS & Associates (info@prsandassociates.co.za)  
2. Que Consolidated  
3. Pulse Credit Management  
4. Maverick and Associates  
5. Able Tracers (or FRS, Accountability Solutions)  

Then add 5–10 more from the CFDC register (e.g. Cape Town + small/medium by employee or branch count) so you have a list of **10–15 small/mid debt companies** to target in SA.

---

## 6. Who to avoid (for now)

| Company | Why |
|---------|-----|
| **Nimble Group** | 1,500 agents, long enterprise cycle, already has Nexidia/speech analytics. Prove value with small collectors first. |
| **Any 500+ agent operation** | Need enterprise features and long sales cycle. Come back after 2–3 small pilots. |

---

## 7. Summary

- **First targets:** Small collectors (5–20 agents) who use Swordfish or basic dialers. CSV in/out pilot; no API required.
- **Sources for names:** CFDC Active Register (authoritative), Brabys (by region), LinkedIn (by size). See also `gemini research` for full company profiles and URLs.
- **Practical first 5:** PRS & Associates (info@prsandassociates.co.za), Que Consolidated, Pulse Credit Management, Maverick and Associates, Able Tracers.
- **Expand to:** Tier 2 (Bredell Ferreira, DPLS, Collect 4U, Van Rhyns, Burger Huyser, NVDB) after 1–2 small pilots.
- **Outreach angle (from Gemini research):** Focus on ROI (no collection no fee = recovery rate matters), compliance as a service (POPIA/CFDC automation), low friction (CSV pilot, no migration), localized context (SA credit climate, multilingual).
